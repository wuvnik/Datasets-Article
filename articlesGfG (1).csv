Create charts from Google Sheets using Google Apps Script,"Google Apps Script is a cloud-based tool used for automating basic tasks. You can write your code in modern JavaScript. Using Apps Script you can add custom menus, write custom functions and macros for Google sheets, and can publish your web Apps. You can automate tasks in Google Sheets, Google Docs, gmail, etc. For using this, you will need a Google account and Google Chrome installed in your system. It is written in script editor in Google Chrome.In this article, we will be writing a script to create a chart from the data available in Google Sheet. Here, we will be using Chart.js which is a JavaScript library. We are basically developing a web app by publishing the script .Web App: The script can be published as web app if it contains the function either doGet(e) or doPost(e) and the function must return HTML Service HtmlOutput object. You will learn how to link HTML file to the script in the steps discussed below. Procedure for writing code in Script Editor:Let’s see step by step implementation.Step 1: Prepare your Google Sheet data. We are having the data of the number of Covid cases in different states in India in lakhs which is as shown below. So, the first step is to prepare your data.Step 2: Add standard Google Apps Script function doGet(e) to code.gs file.  Next step is to go to the tools and select script editor. Save it as ‘Chart’ or any other name.Here we are saving as code.gs . Also create a new HTML file and save it as ‘webappchart.html’ .Add the below code in code.gs file.The above function is the standard Google Apps Script function which is used to publish/deploy your web app. This function returns an output file that is nothing but your HTML file.Now let’ understand the relation between HTML file and code.gs file:Step 3: Add the required CDN in your HTML file. Next open your HTML file i.e webappchart.html and we will include the cdn for jQuery and Chartjs which we will be using to make our chart.<script src=”https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.6.0/jquery.min.js”></script><script src=”https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/Chart.js/3.4.1/chart.js” integrity=”sha512-lUsN5TEogpe12qeV8NF4cxlJJatTZ12jnx9WXkFXOy7yFbuHwYRTjmctvwbRIuZPhv+lpvy7Cm9o8T9e+9pTrg==” crossorigin=”anonymous” referrerpolicy=”no-referrer”>Step 4: Create a canvas for the rendering charts. In the next step we complete our html code by adding canvas for displaying our chart inside a div element in the body tag as written below:The HTML code is completed over here and now we add the script code. Step 5: Adding the jQuery Script Code. We initially write the standard jQuery method which is called when the screen is fully loaded with html code and we call getCases() method inside it which we will be defining in the next step. We then define our getCases() function as below:In the above code we are calling the standard function of Google Apps Script.Syntax:Step 6: Defining function in code.gs file to return data retrieved from Google Sheet. The function getCases which is called over here is defined in the code.gs file as below.Add the below code in code.gs file:Explanation: In the above code we are setting the active spreadsheet to ss and the sheet which is required i.e., Sheet 1 to casesSheet . Then we are getting the last row and setting it in getLastrow variable. Finally we are returning the values from the range given above i.e., starting from second row and so on. An array containing the values from the whole sheet is returned over here and it will be accessible as ar. We are then iterating over the array and pushing the first item in an array as label[] and the second item in an array as data[]. We then will be using these arrays for creating a chart.Step 7: Creating the chart. Now the data is prepared and we create a bar chart as below:Explanation: In the above code we are assigning number of cases to data and labels are nothing but names of different states in my case. Then we are setting the background color and the border colors of all the bars in our bar chart.Step 8: Running the WebApp:Now let’s see the complete code of the above implementation.Output:Attention reader!

Describe closure concept in JavaScript,"In this article, you will learn about the concept of closure in Javascript & how to apply it to the functions. The closure in javascript is a way to combine all the functions & binds them in bundles with the lexical environment. We will deep dive into the closure concept as we grow in this article. Prerequisite: Before we proceed to our main discussion, you should have a good working knowledge of javascript functions i.e. how memory allocation takes place, variable scope concept, the lexical environment in javascript. Let’s first start discussing the basic javascript program examples:In case, if you don’t know how to add & execute the javascript in the HTML document, please refer to Where to put JavaScript in an HTML Document? article for further detailed knowledge.We will quickly view that how the javascript code is being executed. For this, add the <script> tag in the index.html file for a reference to external javascript code or define the code inside the <script> tag. Subsequently, open the developer’s console tab on the browser to see the output of the code.  Now, we will understand all the basic concepts like how the function works, how a function can be declared inside another function using the scope chain, returning the function from the function, through the examples, then will understand the closure concept.Example 1: Here, we are simply illustrating the working of function as shown below:Explanation:  Output: Example 2: In this section, we will discuss the function inside the function using a scope chain to access the variable.Explanation: Output:Example 3: In this case, we will discuss the returning function from the function.Explanation: Output:Example 4:  Here comes the closure part. Let’s say you don’t only have a simple console.log but some variables are also declared inside the function b(). Now, just stop here & think about the output of the code.Explanation: Output: Definition: A closure is the combination of functions bunched together with its lexical environment. The lexical environment is the local function memory & the reference to the lexical environment of a parent. In other words, closure is created when a child function keep the environment of the parent scope even after the parent function has already been executed. This reference to the lexical environment of a parent is the reason why closure functions have access to the variables of outer functions even if those functions are not in the call stack or we can say even if the outer functions are closed.How closures are created: Closure gets created whenever some function is being created at the time of the creation of another function. In the above example, the function inner is being created at the time of the creation of function a(). Few Usecases & Examples of Closures:1. Privacy: Whenever we have to hide some functionality or variable as encapsulation, we wrapped that thing inside the lexical environment of the parent. Example: The below example is a basic template of encapsulation with closures. Explanation: Output: In the first line, Secret Data is being printed when accessed by the closure and in the next line ReferenceError is being thrown by javascript when anyone from outside tries to access that.2. Partial Functions: When we have to create some kind of functionality in which there exists a common pattern then we create a parent function that takes few parameters and create an inner function that takes fewer parameters than the parent. This concept is also called higher-order functions in which we return functions from function. Example: The below example provides a basic illustration of how this partial function looks like. Explanation:Output:",javascript,"['javascript-basics', 'JavaScript-Questions', 'Picked', 'JavaScript', 'Web Technologies']",https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/describe-closure-concept-in-javascript/
How to Create Windows 11 Interface using HTML5 ?,"In this article, we will see how to create a windows 11 interface using HTML5.Approach: To create Windows 11 interface we will use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. If you want to change to design you can add more functionality to it. In this article, we will divide the whole thing into three different part creating the structure, styling the structure and add functionality.Below is the step-by-step implementation of the above approach.Step 1: In this section we will create the basic structure using HTML for the Windows 11 interface. We will give the title as “Try Windows 11” and add necessary images using <img> tag. Also add the necessary links using the <link> tag. Step 2: Styling the Structure: In the previous section, we HAVE created the structure of the windows 11 interface. Now we will add some CSS properties on it. Different classes will have different properties.Class named taskbar will have CSS properties such as:Class named right will have  CSS properties such as:Class named startmenu will have CSS properties such as:Step 3: Add functionality to the website: We will write the JavaScript for the start menu and taskbar. First we will create two variables named taskbar and startmenu then inside this variable we will use the document.getElementsByClassName() method which returns a collection of all elements in the document with the specified class name, as an HTMLCollection object.Now in the taskbar, we will add an event listener for a click that attaches an event handler to the document, and inside it, we will create an if-else statement such as if the bottom property of startmenu is 50px then update it into -655px else if it is not 50px update it into 50px. This will make the taskbar responsive.Output:Attention reader! Don’t stop learning now.

How to detect caps lock key turned on or not ?,"While working with some kind of web application we often need to know various information about user interaction to execute our functionality accordingly i.e. we use APIs to handle button clicks, methods to listen to the keys, etc. Similarly, there may be some cases when we need to know whether Caps Lock is active or not. One use case of this can be the authentication system where the application notifies the user when caps lock is on during entering passwords. Hopefully, javascript provides methods and techniques to work around this situation and we are going to discuss all stuff in this article.KeyboardEvent: This Web API is used to deal with the user interaction by keyboard, the various event describes which kind of activity is been occurred.The event which occurs due to the keyboard comes under KeyboardEvent Object.Modifier Keys: These keys are used in conjunction with other keys to perform some special purpose or shortcut. There are two types of modifier keys that remain activated when pressed i.e. shift, ctrl, alt, etc. The other ones are those which are activated when pressed and deactivated when pressed again i.e. capslock, etc.getModifierState: This is the method of the KeyboardEvent object and returns a boolean on whether the given modifier key is activated or not during that event.Syntax:Example: Now we will detect whether the Capslock key is turned on or not. Here we are going to demonstrate a simple example in which we will detect the activation state of the caps lock key.Step 1: Here we have created a simple HTML page that contains one div with some text and input elements and one paragraph to display warning text.Step 2: This index.js file is attached in the script tag of the former HTML file. We are simply extracting the input element to add an event listener also we are extracting the warning text paragraph to change its style. After then we have passed a callback function to method addEventListener for “keyup” event. Inside that function, we are checking whether the caps lock key was turned on or when the key was released.Output: This would be the output of the above code snippet, each time when we press the key it would generate an event on the key release.  Explanation: Here we have typed “abc” in starting as soon as we press the caps lock the event will generate and then the functionality detects it and changes that p element to appear. Again when we press caps lock the event will generate on the key release and functionality detects it, due to which next time when we will press any key the p tag will hide. Attention reader!

What is the use of integrity attribute in HTML ?,"In this article, we will learn the purpose of using the integrity attribute in HTML & will also understand its implementation through an example. HTML introduced a new attribute called “integrity”. The purpose of the integrity attribute is used to give permission to the browser to check the fetched script to make ensure the source code is never loaded if an unexpected manipulation has been made. It is used to check that whether the third party has been altered the resource or not. A Subresource Integrity (SRI) is a security feature developed by w3consortium, especially for the control of CORS requests. It gives surety that the fetched external scripts would not be altered by the third party. It specifies the base64-encoded cryptographic hash of a resource(source file).The working process of SRI follow as:Syntax: Attributes:Note: The integrity attribute can only be used with the <link> tag or the <script> tag.Example: This example illustrates the HTML integrity attribute by declaring it inside the <script> tag.Output:Attention reader!

How to use a closure to create a private counter in JavaScript ?,"A closure is a combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with references to its surrounding state (the lexical environment). In other words, a closure gives you access to an outer function’s scope from an inner function.Example: Here the inner forms closure with outer. The str variable can be called a private member whose value we can access, but not modify directly.Output:The concept of a private counter means that publicly/globally we could not modify the counter variable directly. The below step-by-step guide will teach you how to implement a private counter with closure and understand it.Step 1: Create counter.js and index.html files. You can give any allowed names to the files.Step 2: First begin with the index.html file and create a front-end to see the counter. We would create a <div> to show the value of the counter and two buttons, one for incrementing and the other for decrementing the counter.Here we are handling clicks on buttons using the counterHandler function which is in the JavaScript file. The value of the buttons helps us to distinguish which button was clicked. And have an id of the div so that we could use it to update it from JavaScript code.Step 3: Let’s now work with the counter.js file and implement behind-the-scenes functions.When the buttons get clicked counterHandler is called, we get the value of the button from objButton Object. If the value is one (1) then to be incremented else to be decremented the value of the counter which is count variable.In the counter function, we have a counter variable count, increment function to increment, and decrement function to decrement the value by one. The modify function is returned as closure to the global when the counter function is called and we store its instance in closure constant.Finally, we modify the div content to the value of the counter returned by closure using its innerHTML property.Step 3: Copy the full path of the HTML index.html file and paste it into any browser. After loading the HTML file in the browser, you would see something similar to it. Now play with the increment and decrement buttons and observe the value of counter changing.Now let’s see what happens in the backend using Developers Tool when the button is clicked. In the below image we had made the counter value equals -1. To see how the scope is defined and related to it.Scope in Developers ToolCounter value on the frontendThis is how you could implement a private counter variable using closures in JavaScript.

What is currying function in JavaScript ?,"It is a technique in functional programming, transformation of the function of multiple arguments into several functions of a single argument in sequence. The translation of function happens something like this,function simpleFunction(param1, param2, param3, …..) => function curriedFunction(param1)(param2)(param3)(….We simply wrap function inside a function, which means we are going to return a function from another function to obtain this kind of translation. The parent function takes the first provided argument and returns the function that takes the next argument and this keeps on repeating till the number of arguments ends. Hopefully, the function that receives the last argument returns the expected result.  Note: An American mathematician named Haskell Curry developed this technique, that’s why it is called as currying.Example 1: Let’s say we have the length, breadth, and height of a cuboid and we want to construct a function that can calculate the volume. The function is being called which consequently executes its code by provided arguments and returns the appropriate result, FInally console.log prints the returned value on console.Output:Example 2: This example explains the currying technique with the help of closures. During the thread of execution, the calculateVolume() function will be invoked. Inside there is an anonymous function, receiving a parameter and returning some code. We are exposing our function from another function, so the closure will be created. Closure always contains the function definition along with the lexical environment of the parent, both things remain connected as a bundle. Hence, it does not matter where we invoke them, the all inner functions will always hold access to the variable of their parent.As soon as we have got the returned result as a function the next argument is ready to be passed, this process will continue till the second last function. Finally, the innermost return keyword returns the expected result.Output:",javascript,"['javascript-functions', 'JavaScript-Questions', 'Picked', 'JavaScript', 'Web Technologies']",https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-currying-function-in-javascript/
React.js Pokémon App.,"Introduction: In this article, we will be going to see how to Build a Pokémon App using React.js and Pokémon API.Pre-requisite:Approach: This web app is going to be a one-paged web app where we are going show to different types of Pokémon and some of their features will also be mentioned there, we will get all these data using a free API resource https://pokeapi.co/. We will set a Load More button, clicking that button the page will load more Pokémon on our webpage (no. of  Pokémon will depend on the limit value that we would have set in our API call ).Now let’s see the step-by-step implementation of the above approach. Creating the react app and installing all the required packages:Step 1: Create a React application using the following command:Step 2: After creating your project folder i.e. foldername, move to it using the following command:Project Structure: It will look like the following.file explorerIgnore the build folder for now, when you will be done with making this app, if you want to deploy your app somewhere then you have to run “npm run build” in your terminal which will create a build folder. Then you just simply need to drag and drop that build folder in your deploying website https://www.netlify.com/.Step 3: Now inside src folder, edit your App.js. For loadPoke you can set any limit that you want, here I have set the limit as 20. In this file we are using two useState hooks container one for fetching all the data with their name using https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/${pokemon.name} within the useEffect and and another one is for loading more Pokémon on onClick event of More Pokemons button fetching the API https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon?limit=20. Then within the  Pokémon app container, we are structuring the whole Pokémon card with required characteristics and setting the props for other components. Step 4: Now inside the src folder, make a Components folder, make two files within this folder one for the Pokémon thumbnail and another one is  for the description.  In your src/Components/PokemonThumnail.js(or whatever name you like to give) paste the code given below. In this file, we are using all the required props which have been passed by the App.js and creating the whole Pokémon thumbnail structure. Here we have useState for show to show the Descripton.js component on clicking the Load More buttons by default it has been set as false .Step 5: Paste the code given below in your src/Components/Description.js(or whatever name you will give). In this file, we are making a component for giving the description about the Pokémon, here also we are using props that have been passed by App.js. There is a know more button in our Pokémon thumbnail, on clicking that particular button this description will be shown in our Thumbnail UI, and on clicking Know less thumbnail will show its initial state.   Step 6: Go to your src/index.css , paste the code given below , this will add styling to your Pokémon web app for all the components.Step to Run Application: Run the application using the following command from the root directory of the project:Output: Now open your browser and go to http://localhost:3000/, you will see the following output:",javascript,"['CSS-Questions', 'JavaScript-Questions', 'React-Questions', 'JavaScript', 'ReactJS', 'Web Technologies']",https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/react-js-pokemon-app/
How to make ajax call from JavaScript ?,"Ajax stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML. It is used to make asynchronous communication with the server. Ajax is used to read data from the server and update the page or send data to the server without affecting the current client page. Ajax is a programming concept. Below are some ways to make Ajax call in JavaScript.Approach 1: In this approach, we will use the XMLHttpRequest object to make Ajax call. The XMLHttpRequest() method which create XMLHttpRequest object which is used to make request with server.  Syntax: Above syntax is used to create XMLHttpRequest object. This object has many different methods which are used to interact with the server to send, receive or interrupt responses from the server. In the response, we get a string from the server that we print. Example: Output: Approach 2: In this approach, we will use jQuery to make an ajax call. The ajax() method is used in jQuery to make ajax calls. It is used as a replacement for all approaches which are not working to make ajax calls. Syntax:Parameter: It takes a configuration file that configures the URL, type, function to call when we get our response or if error, etc. Example: Output: Approach 3: In this approach, we will use fetch() API which is used to make XMLHttpRequest with the server. Because of its flexible structure, it is easy to use. This API makes a request to the server and gets the result as a promise which is resolved to the string.Syntax: Parameter: It takes URL and config of request as parameters. We will configure the data required and make the request to the server. Since it is a resolved promise we use then() function and catch() function to create output for the result. In response, we get the string that we print. Example: Output: ",javascript,"['JavaScript-Methods', 'javascript-object', 'JavaScript-Questions', 'Picked', 'JavaScript', 'Web Technologies']",https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-make-ajax-call-from-javascript/
How to write a function in JavaScript ?,"Introduction: A function is a collection of reusable code that may be invoked from anywhere in your application. This avoids the need to write the same code again and over. It aids programmers in the creation of modular code. Functions enable a programmer to break down a large program into several smaller and more manageable functions.Functions are one of JavaScript’s core building elements. In JavaScript, a function is comparable to a procedure—a series of words that performs a task or calculates a value—but for a process to qualify as a function, it must accept some input and produce an output with a clear link between the input and the result. To utilize a function, it must be defined in some place within the scope from which it will be called.Function Definition: A function definition or function statement starts with the function keyword and continues with the following.Syntax:Function Calling: To call a function at a later point in the script, simply type the function’s name. By default, all JavaScript functions can utilize arguments objects. Each parameter’s value is stored in an arguments object. The arguments object is similar to an array. Its values may be accessed using an index, much like an array. It does not, however, provide array methods.  Output:Function Arguments: A function can contain one or more arguments that are sent by the calling code and can be utilized within the function. Because JavaScript is a dynamically typed programming language, a function argument can have any data type as a value.Output:Return Value: A return statement is an optional part of a JavaScript function. If you wish to return a value from a function, you must do this. This should be the final statement of a function.Output:Function Expression: We may assign a function to a variable and then utilize that variable as a function in JavaScript. It is known as a function expression.Output:Types of functions in JavaScript:1. Named function: A named function is one that we write in code and then use whenever we need it by referencing its name and providing it some parameters. Named functions come in handy when we need to call a function several times to give various values to it or run it multiple times.Output:2. Anonymous function: We can define a function in JavaScript without giving it a name. This nameless function is referred to as the anonymous function. A variable must be assigned to an anonymous function.Output:3. Nested Functions: A function in JavaScript can contain one or more inner functions. These nested functions fall within the purview of the outer function. The inner function has access to the variables and arguments of the outer function. However, variables declared within inner functions cannot be accessed by outer functions.Output:4. Immediately invoked function expression: The browser executes the invoked function expression as soon as it detects it. This function has the advantage of running instantly where it is situated in the code and producing direct output. That is, it is unaffected by code that occurs later in the script and can be beneficial.Output:",javascript,"['javascript-functions', 'JavaScript-Questions', 'Picked', 'JavaScript', 'Web Technologies']",https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-write-a-function-in-javascript/
Top 7 Python Libraries Used For Hacking,"The term hacking has been around for a long time, the first recorded instance of hacking actually dates back to the early 1960s in Massachusetts Institute of Technology where both the terms hacking and hacker who were coined since then hacking has actually evolved into a broadly followed discipline for the computing community. Nowadays, ethical hacking is the process of detecting the vulnerabilities in the system by getting unauthorized access into the particular system to perform activities that can range from deleting filers to stealing some sensitive information.Python is known as one of the fastest-growing programming languages and is versatile and widely used by security experts and hackers for ethical hacking. In this piece, you will read about 7 python libraries effective for ethical hacking. Being an open-source language, Python allows programmers to create multiple sets of pre-combined codes and forming libraries that make the python script more comprehensive and secure.Apart from the application of python to web development, data science, and machine learning, it is successfully used by hackers and cybersecurity departments for identifying a break in computer networks and compromising the security protocols. Python programming is also used by ethical hackers to develop effective hacking tools and techniques that could find malware and vulnerabilities that lower down the efficiency of systems with the use of python scripts.Python libraries reduce the load of developing codes from scratch. With already formulated code libraries, ethical hackers can use them to make their tasks easier. Ethical hacking happens where there are potential threats to computer networks and as a result, the security gets compromised with unidentified or illegal access to the systems. Python is vastly popular because of its super-powerful yet easy-to-use libraries that are easily available to developers. Despite the fact that Python comes with minimal syntax and awesome readability, but nothing beats the fact that developer’s lives get really simple with these libraries which are available in all sorts of domains, for example, artificial intelligence has PI touch intensive loop while data science has pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, and so on. Here are some of the top 7 Python libraries used for hacking and each one has its unique identification and function.The requests library helps one to allow HTTP requests to be more user-friendly. It returns responsive objects including data of status, encoding, and content. It is a module that can be used to send all kinds of HTTP requests it is very easy to use and has features like passing parameters in the URL and passing custom headers as well. It is a human-friendly HTTP library as it also suggests on the official documentation page as well and it is one of the most downloaded Python libraries with more than 400,000 downloads every day. Python requests are so popular because developers don’t have to manually add the queries to the URLs and form encode post data and that is reason enough to use Python requests.Cryptography is a library that helps with encryption as well as the description of sets of data. The library includes primitives supported by Python 3.3+, Python 2.6-2.7. Cryptography involves the amalgamation of two layers that is, namely safe cryptographic recipes that require minimum configuration choices. While another one is low-level cryptography which is most dangerous and can be used incorrectly. This python library helps to secure information with the help of effectively developed codes. Cryptography includes the generation of random numbers, digital signatures, hashing, stream ciphers, and hashing.Nmap is a typical network scanner tool using IP packets for the identification of devices on a network and information regarding operating systems. With the use of the Nmap port scanner, this library helps the system administrators automate the task for scanning reports supporting the Nmap scripts outputs. Nmap helps to identify and discover hosts on networks and detects the version number, application name functioning on any remote devices.The library consists of Python scripts that aids with working on network protocols, it ensures low-level programming access to other packets along with the implementation of the protocols. Packets can be made out of raw data, and the API makes deep hierarchies protocols work efficiently. Impacket’s goal is to make tasks easier for programmers so that they can work under a framework while abiding by some custom protocols.The tool to manipulate network packets, helping with discovering networks, probing, tracing, routing, and scanning. Scapy includes diverse functionalities apart from packet sniffing and can be customized as peruse. It can be run on Linux, Mac OS, and windows. It presents decoded packets with the interpretation depending on the user. Scapy works to bring semblance between high leveled protocols and low-level networks programming.A layer 2 python library that encourages communication with MAC addresses. One can create custom-made WiFi communication using rawsocketpy. A non-simultaneous server with an uptight capability with no encryption needs an MTU of 1500. Rawsocketpy does not involve transmission control protocol or user datagram protocol.A libnet packet injection library ensures functionality for sending packets, presentation of libcap traces along with having a python API for libnet packets. These are some of the python libraries holding an efficacy under ethical hacking. Python language is used by tech companies because of its versatility and secure algorithms. Python gained much popularity in the last few decades. It has been used by a lot of developers, hackers of big companies because of its easy-to-understand and general-purpose syntax that can be applied to a large number of programming domains. There are countless python libraries available on the web, but the ones listed above are best suited for ethical hacking.",python,"['GBlog', 'Python']",https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/top-7-python-libraries-used-for-hacking/
Python – Preprocessing of Tamil Text,"Preprocessing is the major part of Natural Language Processing. In order to classify any text with high accuracy, cleaned data plays a major role. So, the first step in NLP before analyzing or classifying is preprocessing of data.   Many python libraries support preprocessing for the English language. But for the Tamil Language, there are very few preprocessing libraries available. Here is an example of a few preprocessing techniques for Tamil text.The preprocessing techniques involved in this article are           Output:!”#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\]^_`{|}~ If there are any of the above punctuations in the text, they will be removed after preprocessing. This can be removed by using the python string module.  Output: வெற்றி பெற வேண்டும் என்ற பதற்றம் இல்லாமல் இருப்பது தான் வெற்றி பெறுவதற்கான சிறந்த வழிExplanation:  All the punctuations in the given text are removed.Tokenization is nothing but splitting each word in a sentence into a token which will be used for further classification. To convert a text into tokens, a regular expression module in python is used.Output:[‘வெற்றி’, ‘பெற’, ‘வேண்டும்’, ‘என்ற’, ‘பதற்றம்’, ‘இல்லாமல்’, ‘இருப்பது’, ‘தான்’, ‘வெற்றி’, ‘பெறுவதற்கான’, ‘சிறந்த’, ‘வழி’]Explanation:  All the words in a sentence are split into tokens.Stop words are frequently used words in a language.

Identify Members of BTS — An Image Classifier,"BTS is an eminent K-Pop band comprising of 7 members. This article looks at an image classifier that would recognize the name of the band member from a picture. The image classifier would be built using fastai. It is a deep learning library that aims to democratize deep learning. It is built on top of PyTorch, and has plethora of models with optimized weights that are ready-to-use. The application would be hosted on Binder, and the end product would look like this: As is the case with any image classifier, the model needs to be trained on a dataset from which it can infer and extract the features corresponding to a particular category. The BTS Image Classifier would contain 7 categories (total number of members). The dataset can be prepared by manually collecting images of different members and then clubbing them in a folder of that category. In order to fasten this process, a Python script can be employed to create the dataset. The script would fetch images from Google Image Search. (Disclaimer: Using these images may lead to a copyright violation so proceed at your own risk). A folder called simple_images would appear at the location where the script is present. Inside the simple_images folder, the folders corresponding to each of the seven members with 150 images would be present. It is time to code the classifier. It is recommended to use Google Collab (the GPU would come in handy while training) and have the dataset uploaded to Google Drive.DataLoaders is a class that is responsible for providing the valid and train dataset to the model. The images that have been downloaded may not be of the same dimensions. It is preferred to have all the images in the dataset of uniform dimensionality. The fastai library has a function for this: All the images are resized to 224 x 224 which is a standard size for images in the training dataset. It is time to create the Learner. The Learner is the model that is going to learn from the dataset that is provided. It will then be able to predict the output (independent variable) when supplied with an image that was not a part of the training set. The Learner that is used here is called ‘Resnet18’. It is already pretrained, meaning the weights are tweaked such that the model should be able to reasonable predictions without further tweaks. This idea is called transfer learning. fine_tune(8) means the learning takes place for 8 epochs. This number can be played with. The tradeoff between accuracy and the computation power/time would be something to consider. The model is now trained, and the result can be visualized by looking at the confusion matrix.   Ideally, only the diagonal elements of the confusion matrix should be non-zero. It can be seen that in the model’s predictions, there are some misclassifications present. The images with the top losses can be seen. These are usually the images which the model predicts incorrectly with great certainty or correctly with less certainty. The model would be deployed using Binder. The GitHub URL of the notebook needs to be pasted. Firstly, the model needs to be exported, and a file with the extension .pkl  needs to be generated. Visit the website for Binder. Paste the URL of the GitHub repository, containing the notebook and .pkl file. In the ‘URL to open’ blank, enter the (GitHub) URL of the notebook. Click on ‘launch’, and after a few minutes, the web-application would be ready to be used. Note: This image classifier was first taught in the Fast.AI Deep Learning course, lecture 2. Attention reader!

Integrating Django with Reactjs using Django REST Framework,"In this article, we will learn the process of communicating between the Django Backend and React js frontend using the Django REST Framework. For the sake of a better understanding of the concept, we will be building a Simple Task Manager and go through the primary concepts for this type of integration between React js and Django.Reactjs in a nutshell is a Javascript library for developing Single Page Applications(SPA) with very detailed and well-structured documentation. For this project, React will serve as the Frontend, handling the User Interface(UI) through the Request to Django’s backend.Let’s take a look first at what we will be building. The below images shows the UI of the Task Manager.This task manager application is a sort of to-do list. Here we will have three buttons as “Completed”,”Incomplete” and a button to add the task named “Add task” as shown in the above image.In order to add a task, you click on the Add task button which will open up a window within the app to add the task as shown below. Here we can add the “Title” for the task and give it a description inside the “Description” section. Finally, you can check or uncheck depending upon the status of the task(ie, Completed or Incomplete) as shown in the below image:After you “Save” the task, you can navigate between the Completed and Incomplete tabs to keep track of the tasks as shown below:Here you will also have the option to “Delete” or “Edit” and existing task as shown below:All of the operations performed above is managed by the Django REST Framework.So the following are the prerequisites for the project:To verify if you have python 3 installed, use the following command in your command prompt( Since this project is developed on a Windows machine, we will be using the command prompt but depending upon your operating system you can use the terminal):This will show up the current python version on your system as shown below:To check if the Node module is installed, use the below command:This will show you the node version on your system as shown below:At this point, we are good to go as we have Python and Node js installed in our system.Let’s start with the Backend.Now let’s open up our command prompt. Now follow the below steps in the same order to follow along with this article.Step 1: Create a directory named “django-react-app” using the below command(the command may change slightly depending upon your OS):Step 2: Moved into the directory that we just created using the below command:Step 3: Now create a virtual environment using the below command:We have named our virtual environment “dar”, short for Django and react. This is necessary as we don’t have to install packages and dependencies globally. It is also a good programming practice.Step 4: Activate the virtual environment that we just created using the below command:This will activate our virtual machine as shown below:Step 5: Now install Django inside the virtual machine using the below command:You will get a similar message as your installation gets completed:Step 6: Now let’s create our project named “backend” for our Django backend. To do so use the below command:The django-react-app will be our main folder and inside it, we will have two folders, one for the backend and one for the frontend that we will create later.Step 7: Now navigate to the backend folder using the below command:Step 8: Now we will start our app and call it “todo” using the below command:The app gets created using the above command as shown below:Now let’s go ahead and start up the VS code and open the project folder inside it. At this stage our project structure will look like below: Step 9: Now use the below command to migrate the project:The migrations will be applied as shown below:Step 10: Now let’s run the server using the below command:Now you can visit the localhost to check if the project has started properly. As you can see in the below image the project is up and running:Step 11: Now we need to take some configuration steps inside the settings.py file. In the INSTALLED_APPS section add the name of the app that we created (ie, todo) as shown below:  At this point, the settings.py file would look like below: Step 12: Next, we will need to create a Model. The Model will determine how the todo items are stored in the database. We will have three properties in the model:So go ahead and open the models.py file and the following code:  We will also create a string representation of the title inside the Todo class as follows: At this point, our models.py file will look like:Step 13: Now let’s go ahead and make migrations. Note that every time you make changes to the models.py file, we will need to make migrations. Use the below command to do so:The following message will be generated when your migration is ready:Step 14: Now let’s apply all migrations using the below command:This will apply our migrations as shown below:Now we can test to see that the CRUD operations work on the todo model file using the Admin site (or, the interface). For this we will need to register the models in the admin.py file.Step 15: Open up the admin.py file and add up the following code in it:Step 16: Now let’s create a superuser using the below command:Here we will be using the following credentials:Note: You can set up your credentials as per your need. The above credentials need not be the same. We would get the following message when the superuser gets created:Step 17: Now let’s run the server and check everything is going as intended so far using the below command:Navigate to the following link:This will show us the admin page as shown below:Here fill up your credentials and log in. We will use the credentials that we used while creating the superuser:This will lead us to the following page. Here we can see our users, the app, and the groups as shown below:Users:Todo:Let’s add some task to it and save it as shown below:We can see this task listed on the todo section as shown below:To create the API we will need to install the Django REST Framework for Serializers. We also need to django-cors-headers for whitelisting port 3000, which is the default port for React.Now follow the below steps to create the Django REST framework:Step 1:  To install the Django REST framework use the below command in the backend directory:The following message will be displayed once the installation is completed:Step 2: Now install the django-cors-headers using the below command:The following message will be displayed once the installation is completed:Step 3: Now open up the setting.py file and add both the dependencies that we just installed to INSTALLED_APPS as shown below:  Step 4: Also in the settings.py file we need to whitelist the localhost port 3000. If we don’t do that there will be a block between the localhost:8000 and localhost:3000. Add the following code to achieve the same:   Step 5: In the MIDDLEWARE section we need to add the cors-headers settings as shown below: At this point, our settings.py would look like below:Now we need to create the Sereilizers for the Todo data Model. The Serilaizers are responsible for Serializers is to create model instances to JSON. This will help the frontend to work with the received data easily. JSON is the standard for data interchange on the web.Step 6: Now create a file inside the todo folder and name it serializers.py. Inside the folder add the following code:  Step 7: Now it’s time to create the Views. So open up the views.py file. Now add the following code to the file:   Step 8: Now open up the urls.py file and add the following code to it. This is the final step for creating the REST API and we can now perform all CRUD operations. Routers allow us to make queries. For example, if we go the the “tasks”, this will return the list of all the tasks. Also, you can have a single ‘task’ with an id to return a single task, where id is the primary key.Now let’s check if we are moving forward in the right direction. So run the server and navigate to the following URL:If everything is good, we will get the following outcome:As you can see our API is up and running.Now if we navigate to the following links we can view and interact with our tasks:Now let’s build the frontend for our Todo app. For this follow the below steps:Step 1: Navigate to the main project directory(ie, django-react-app) and activate the virtual environment using the below command:Step 2: Now use the below command to create a boilerplate of React js app:Here, npx stands for Node Package Executable. After the boilerplate is setup you will get the following message:We will be also needing some UI flair for the UI design, specifically reactstrap and bootstrap.Step 3: So, use the below command to install reactstrap and bootstrap in the project:Step 4: First move into the Frontend folder and use the below command to run the React server to make sure everything if working till this point:If everything is fine, you’ll get the following page on the localhost:3000Step 5: Now open up the App.js file in the frontend folder. And clear the boilerplate code and change it to the below code:  At this point the frontend will look like below:  As you can see in the above image. Any changes made to the App.js file are reflected directly to the UI. Step 6: Now the code to the App.js file. Comments are added to the code for better understanding.   Step 7: Now open up the Index.css file, clear the CSS inside it and add the following CSS in the file: Step 8: Now create a new folder named “Components” in the src directory and add a file Modal.js to it. Then add the following code to it.  Step 10: Make the changes to the index.js file as follows: For us to make requests to the API endpoints on the backend server of Django, we will need to install Axios. Use the following command inside the frontend folder to install Axios:Output:Congratulation!!. At this point, you have successfully build a Fullstack Django-React app and Used the Django REST framework to establish communication between the frontend and backend. Attention geek!

Connect Flask to a Database with Flask-SQLAlchemy,"Flask is a micro web framework written in python. Micro-framework is normally a framework with little to no dependencies on external libraries. Though being a micro framework almost everything can be implemented using python libraries and other dependencies when and as required.In this article, we will be building a Flask application that takes data in a form from the user and then displays it on another page on the website. We can also delete the data. We won’t focus on the front-end part rather we will be just coding the backend for the web application.In any directory where you feel comfortable create a folder and open the command line in the directory. Create a python virtual environment using the command below.Once the command is done running activate the virtual environment using the command below.Now, install Flask using pip(package installer for python). Simply run the command below.Once the installation is done create a file name app.py and open it in your favorite editor. To check whether Flask has been properly installed you can run the following code.Output:Now, let’s move on to creating a database for our application. For the purpose of this article, we will be using SQLAlchemy a database toolkit, and an ORM(Object Relational Mapper). We will be using pip again to install SQLAlchemy. The command is as follows,In your app.py file import SQLAlchemy as shown in the below code. We also need to add a configuration setting to our application so that we can use SQLite database in our application. We also need to create an SQLAlchemy database instance which is as simple as creating an object.In sqlalchemy we use classes to create our database structure. In our application, we will create a Profile table that will be responsible for holding the user’s id, first name, last name, and age.The table below explains some of the keywords used in the model class. Columnused to create a new column in the database tableIntegerAn integer data fieldprimary_keyIf set to True for a field ensures that the field can be used to uniquely identify objects of the data table.StringAn string data field. String(<maximum length>)uniqueIf set to True it ensures that every data in that field in unique.nullableIf set to False it ensures that the data in the field cannot be null.__repr__Function used to represent objects of the data table.In the command line which is navigated to the project directory and virtual environment running, we need to run the following commands. The above command will initiate a python bash in your command line where you can use further lines of code to create your data table according to your model class in your database. After the commands, the response would look like something in the picture and in your project directory you will notice a new file named ‘site.db’. Install Flask-Migrate using pip Now, in your app.py add two lines, the code being as follows, Now to create migrations we run the following commands one after the other.flask db initflask db migrate -m “Initial migration”flask db upgradeNow we have successfully created the data table in our database.Before moving forward and building our form let’s create an index page for our website. The HTML file is always stored inside a folder in the parent directory of the application named ‘templates’. Inside the templates folder create a file named index.html and paste the below code for now. We will go back to adding more code into our index file as we move on. In the app.py add a small function that will render an HTML page at a specific route specified in app.route. To test whether everything is working fine you can run your application using the command The command will set up a local server at http://localhost:5000.Output:We will be creating an HTML page in which our form will be rendered. Create an HTML file named add_profile in your templates folder. The HTML code is as follows. The important points in the code will be highlighted as you read on.Adding a function in our application to render the form pageIn our app.py file, we will add the following function. At route or site path ‘http://localhost:5000/add_data’ the page will be rendered.  To check whether the code is working fine or not, you can run the following command to start the local server. Now, visit http://localhost:5000/add_data and you will be able to see the form.Output: To add data to the database we will be using the “POST” method. POST is used to send data to a server to create/update a resource. In flask where we specify our route that is app.route we can also specify the HTTP methods there. Then inside the function, we create variables to store data and use request objects to procure data from the form. Note: The name used in the input tags in the HTML file has to be the same one that is being been used in this function,For example,  “age” should also be used in the python function as, Then we move on to create an object of the Profile class and store it in our database using database sessions. Once the function is executed it redirects us back to the index page of the application.On our index page now, we will be displaying all the data that has been stored in our data table. We will be using ‘Profile.query.all()‘ to query all the objects of the Profile class and then use Jinja templating language to display it dynamically on our index HTML file.Update your index file as follows. The delete function will be written later on in this article. For now, we will query all the data from the data table and display it on our home page. We loop through every object in profiles that we pass down to our template in our index function and print all its data in a tabular form. The index function in our app.py is updated as follows. To delete data we have already used an anchor tag in our table and now we will just be associating a function with it.The function queries data on the basis of id and then deletes it from our database.Complete CodeThe entire code for app.py, index.html, and add-profile.html has been given. app.pyindex.html add_profile.html Output:  Attention geek!

Watermarking images with OpenCV and Python,"In this article, we are going to see how to make watermarking images using OpenCV in Python.Watermark is intentionally left Text/Logo onto the image. Watermarks are generally used by artists to protect the copyright of the image. Using watermarks we can ensure that the owner of the image is the person who imprinted the watermark on the image. Let’s understand this with the help of an example, what do we mean by a watermark on an image:Image before watermarkLogo:logo.jpgStep 1: Import the OpenCV and read the logo and the image on which you want to apply a watermark.Step 2: Calculate the height and width of both the images and save them to other variables. We need to calculate the width and height because we are going to place our watermark somewhere onto the image and for that, we just have to know the proper width and height of the both logo and the image.Here, we have used the shape function from OpenCV, which returns the tuple of height and width of the image.Step 3: Now, we are going to calculate the coordinates of the center of the image, because we are going to place our watermark at the center of the image.Step 4: To add a watermark to an image we will use the addWeighted function from OpenCV. Firstly we will be providing the destination where we want to place the watermark, then we will pass that destination to the addWeighted function with the image and logo.Syntax: cv2.addWeighted(source1, alpha, source2, beta, gamma)In our case, source 1 will be the image where we want to place our logo and alpha will be the opacity of the logo and source2 will be the logo itself and we will set beta accordingly the alpha that is opacity and gamma will be 0. Step 5: After that, we are simply displaying the result and saving the output. To display the output we have used imshow function and to write/save the image, we are using imwrite function in both the functions firstly we have to provide the file name as a parameter and then the file itself. cv2.waitKey(0) is used to wait until the user press Esc Key, after that the cv2.destroyAllWindows function will close the window.Below is the full implementation:Output:After watermarked Attention geek!

Olympics Data Analysis Using Python,"In this article, we are going to see the Olympics analysis using Python. The modern Olympic Games or Olympics are leading international sports events featuring summer and winter sports competitions in which thousands of athletes from around the world participate in a variety of competitions. The Olympic Games are considered the world’s foremost sports competition with more than 200 nations participating.The total number of events in the Olympics is 339 in 33 sports. And for every event there are winners. Therefore various data is generated. So, by using Python we will analyze this data.When dealing with Olympic data, we have two CSV files. One containing outturn sports-related costs of the Olympic Games of all years. And other is containing the information about athletes of all years when they participated with information.CSV data file can be download from here: DatasetsWe imported both the datasets using the .read_csv() method into a dataframe using pandas and displayed the first 5 rows of each dataset.Output:Here we are going to merge two dataframe using pandas.merge() in python.Output: Data is now available now using pandas and matplotlib lets see some examplesCreating a new data frame including only gold medalists.Output : Here we are going to create a graph of the number of gold medals with respect to age.

Broken Pipe Error in Python,"In this article, we will discuss Pipe Error in python starting from how an error is occurred in python along with the type of solution needed to be followed to rectify the error in python. So, let’s go into this article to understand the concept well. With the advancement of emerging technologies in the IT sector, the use of programming language is playing a vital role. Thus the proper language is considered for the fast executions of the functions. In such a case, Python emerges as the most important language to satisfy the needs of the current problem execution because of its simplicity and availability of various libraries. But along with the execution, the errors during the execution also comes into existence and it becomes difficult for the programmers to rectify the errors for the processing of the problem.A broken Pipe Error is generally an Input/Output Error, which is occurred at the Linux System level. The error has occurred during the reading and writing of the files and it mainly occurs during the operations of the files. The same error that occurred in the Linux system is EPIPE, but every library function which returns its error code also generates a signal called SIGPIPE, this signal is used to terminate the program if it is not handled or blocked. Thus a program will never be able to see the EPIPE error unless it has handled or blocked SIGPIPE.Python interpreter is not capable enough to ignore SIGPIPE by default, instead, it converts this signal into an exception and raises an error which is known as IOError(INPUT/OUTPUT error) also know as ‘Error 32’ or Broken Pipe Error.python <filename>.py | headThis pipeline code written above will create a process that will send the data upstream and a process that reads the data downstream. But when the downstream process will not be able to read the data upstream, it will raise an exception by sending SIGPIPE signal to the upstream process. Thus upstream process in a python problem will raise an error such as IOError: Broken pipe error will occur.Example:When we run this file from unix commands:Approach 1: To avoid the error we need to make the terminal run the code efficiently without catching the SIGPIPE signal, so for these, we can add the below code at the top of the python program.Output:Explanation:The above code which is placed on the top of the python code is used to redirect the SIGPIPE signals to the default SIG_DFL signal, which the system generally ignores so that the rest part of the code can be executed seamlessly. But Approach 11 is not effective because in the Python manual on the signal library, which is mentioned that this type of signal handling should be avoided and should not be practiced in any part of the code. So for this reason we will go for the second approach.Approach 2: We can handle this type of error by using the functionality of try/catch block which is already approved by the python manual and is advised to follow such procedure to handle the errors.Example:Output:Explanation:In the above piece of code, we have used the built-in library of python which is the Sys and Errno module, and use the try/catch block in order to catch the raised SIGPIPE exception and handle it before it stops the program execution. Attention geek!

Multithreaded crawler in Python,"In this article, we will describe how it is possible to build a simple multithreading-based crawler using Python.bs4: Beautiful Soup (bs4) is a Python library for extracting data from HTML and XML files. To install this library, type the following command in IDE/terminal.requests: This library allows you to send HTTP/1.1 requests very easily. To install this library, type the following command in IDE/terminal.Step 1: We will first import all the libraries that we need to crawl. If you’re using Python3, you should already have all the libraries except BeautifulSoup, requests. So if you haven’t installed these two libraries yet, you’ll need to install them using the commands specified above.Step 2: Create a main program and then create an object of class MultiThreadedCrawler and pass the seed URL to its parameterized constructor, and call run_web_scrawler() method.Step 3: Create a class named MultiThreadedCrawler. And initialize all the variables in the constructor, assign base URL to the instance variable named seed_url. And then format the base URL into absolute URL, using schemes as HTTPS and net location.To execute the crawl frontier task concurrently use multithreading in python. Create an object of ThreadPoolExecutor class and set max workers as 5 i.e To execute 5 threads at a time. And to avoid duplicate visits to web pages, In order to maintain the history create a set data structure.Create a queue to store all the URLs of crawl frontier and put the first item as a seed URL.Step 4: Create a method named run_web_crawler(), to keep on adding the link to frontier and extracting the information use an infinite while loop and display the name of the currently executing process.Get the URL from crawl frontier, for lookup assign timeout as 60 seconds and check whether the current URL is already visited or not. If not visited already, Format the current  URL and add it to scraped_pages set to store in the history of visited pages and choose from a pool of threads and pass scrape page and target URL.Step 5: Using the handshaking method place the request and set default time as 3 and maximum time as 30 and once the request is successful return the result set.Step 6: Create a method named scrape_info(). And pass the webpage data into BeautifulSoap which helps us to organize and format the messy web data by fixing bad HTML and present to us in an easily-traversible structure.Using the BeautifulSoup operator extract all the text present in the HTML document.Step 7: Create a method named parse links, using BeautifulSoup operator extract all the anchor tags present in HTML document. Soup.find_all(‘a’,href=True) returns a list of items that contain all the anchor tags present in the webpage. Store all the tags in a list named anchor_Tags. For each anchor tag present in the list Aachor_Tags, Retrieve the value associated with href in the tag using Link[‘href’]. For each retrieved URL check whether it is any of the absolute URL or relative URL.If it is a Relative URL using urljoin method change it to an absolute URL using the base URL and relative URL. Check whether the current URL is already visited or not. If the URL has not been visited already, put it in the crawl queue.Step 8: For extracting the links call the method named parse_links() and pass the result. For extracting the content call the method named scrape_info() and pass the result.Below is the complete implementation:Output: Attention geek!

Lambda expressions basically express instances of functional interfaces An interface with a single abstract method is called a functional interface. One example is java.lang.Runnable.Lambda expressions implement only one abstract function and therefore implement functional interfaces. Predicate interface is an example of a functional interface that has only one abstract method called test().Illustration:The above is a functional interface that has one abstract method test receiving only one parameter of type T and returns a boolean value. This method is a generic method that takes a type parameter. This interface can be implemented anywhere in a program using a lambda expression instead of creating classes with multiple functions. For eg, to implement a runnable interface used only for multithreading one needs to implement only a run() method. Then there is the comparable interface which can be implemented using compare() method.Important points:These are for single–line lambda expressions having void return type.Type 1: No Parameter.Syntax:It takes interface of the following form:Type 2: Single Parameter.Syntax:It is not mandatory to use parentheses if the type of that variable can be inferred from the contextIt takes interface of the following form:The type and return type of the lamdas are automatically inferred.Type 3: Multi parametersIt is not mandatory to use parentheses if the type of that variable can be inferred from the contextIt takes interface of the following form:The type and return type of the lamdas are automatically inferred.Now, we are done with discussing out the theoretical concept, now let us come up with the implementation part. So here primarily we will be discussing out the codes for the above three types as discussed above:Note: forEach() method is of Iterable interface that is used to iterate through a collection. Here it takes an argument of Consumer type interface. This is a functional interface having only one abstract method called accept(). Since it is a functional interface, a lambda expression can be passed.Hence, if we do conclude out the above Example 1: Lambda expression with no parametersExample 2: Type 2 Lambda expression with a single parameterExample 3: Type 3 Lambda expression with multi parametersAttention reader!

Java Program to Create Set of Pairs Using HashSet,"Problem statement: We need to find and print unique pairs among all given pairs.Generally, if we have to find the unique numbers among all given numbers then we just put all numbers in HashSet and print them. Let us consider a sample illustration to interpret the problem statement better. Suppose we have three pairs be customly they are (3, 5), (4, 5), (3, 5). Now if we put it in the set then the output will be.Note: But in the case of Pair, we can’t just write as shown below but if we try to put Pair in a set then it gives us the problem for illustration. From the example, we can clearly see that duplicate pairs are still present. This is because for the set, Pair is the same type of object and it can’t differentiate between them. So to overcome this problem we can just make a string of indexes and values of  Pairs and store it in Set in form of String and then print it and you can get all unique pairs.ExampleOutput explanation:So from the code and output, you can clearly see that duplicate pairs are deleted and we can get all unique pairs without overriding the hashCode() method and equals() method.Attention reader!

How to Create Different Packages For Different Classes in Java?,"Let us first know what is a class and package in Java. Class in java is a model for creating objects. It means that the properties and actions of the objects are written in class. Properties are represented by variables and actions of the objects are represented by methods. So, a class contains variables and methods. The same variables are also available in the objects because they are created from the class. These variables are also called ‘instance variables’  because they are created inside the object (instance).Illustration:Output: Note: Here the keyword class is used to declare a class. After this, we should write a class name. In the class, we write instance variables and methods.Packages in JavaIn Java, Packages are a collection of classes, sub-packages, and interfaces. i.e A package represents a dictionary that contains a related group of classes and interfaces. Whenever we write a statement be it as shown below we are importing all the classes of the java.io.*  package. Here, java is a directory name and io is another sub-directory within it. And the * represents all the classes and interfaces of that io subdirectory. We have many such packages, for example, java.lang, java.util, and there do exists many more inside which there do lies classes inside the package. In order to use so let us do take most frequently used packages that are ‘lang’ package for java designing and ‘io’ package for input-output operations.Let us discuss the advantages of packages in java that are as follows:There are two types of packages in java as listed:Type 1: Built-in PackagesThese are the packages that are already available in the Java language. These packages provide nearly all necessary classes, interfaces, and methods for the programmer to perform any task. They are as follows:Type 2: User-defined PackagesJust like the built-in packages shown earlier, the user of the java language can also create their own packages. They are called User Defined Packages. These packages can also be imported into other classes and used exactly in the same way as built-in packages. Syntax: Creating a package, package keyword is used2.1.1 To create a package2.1.2 To create a subpackage within a package2.2 Compile2.3 To run the programAbove syntax is valid only for windows CMD shell, fo rlinux and mac zsh shell refer to below media as perceive it the same way provided belowImplementation:Now let us divide the class into packagesStep 1: Define a class StudentData that holds the following information of a student:Note that these fields should be declared private.Step 2: Create another class StudentDataExtended with a private attribute named location. It is basically a string that stores the location of the student.Step 3: Now in this class define a method addDetails() method that stores the details of students; and a method printDetails() method that outputs the details of students in the sorted order of their id.Note: Both the classes should be in different packages Illustration:Output:Implementation:Now let us come up with real runnable examples to implement what we discussed and illustrated above:Example 1-A:Example 1-B:OUTPUT:Attention reader!

Limitations of synchronization and the uses of static synchronization in multithreading,"Multithreading feature of java is the feature around which the concept revolves as it allows concurrent execution of two or more parts of a program for maximum utilization of CPU. Each part of such a program is called a thread. So, threads are lightweight processes within a process where as we all know threads can be created by using two mechanisms as listed:If multiple threads access a single resource at a time then there exists a possibility of data racing or bad output. Let us understand this with the help of a story. Let us take the example of data racing in multithreading to perceive the limitations of synchronization and the uses of static synchronization. Let us lick off directly with the data racing in multithreading.Implementation:Shubham and Sharmistha was planning a date and tried to book movie tickets. Unfortunately, only 1 ticket was available. Shubham who was a genius Java programmer knew a trick and requested 1 ticket simultaneously for both of them at the same time. The naive ticket booking system assigned 2 threads and passed them through the book method. In the end of the procedure, both of them got 1 ticket each and the number of tickets left was -1!Illustration: Data racing in multithreadingOutput-Number of tickets can not be negative. To handle this problem engineers came up with the synchronization concept.Synchronization- we provide a lock to the object and declare a sensitive area(withdraw method). An object can have multiple threads but the sensitive area can only be accessed by 1 thread at a time.Illustration: Handling data racing due to multithreading using synchronization.Output-Limitations of synchronization:If we have multiple thread from 1 object than synchronization will handle the data racing or bad output. What will happen if multiple threads are assigned from multiple objects? this will again result in bad output or data racing.Illustration: Cons of synchronization when multiple threads gets assigned from multiple objects.Output-We have only 1 ticket but due to data racing both of them booked successfully! To handle this problem we need to study static synchronization.Static Synchronization- Say we have 5 objects. Each objects have multiple threads. Now the sensitive area will be accessed by 5 threads at a time!To handle this problem engineers came up with the idea of Static synchronization. We provide a lock to the class. The class will select 1 object at a time. The object in turn will choose 1 thread and pass it through the sensitive area. Illustration: Handing data racing using static synchronization.Output-Using static synchronization, we have prepared a system to prevent illegal ticket booking.Conclusion-Attention reader!

Java Program To Perform Union of Two Linked Lists Using Priority Queue,"Given two linked lists, your task is to complete the function make union(), which returns the union of two linked lists. This union should include all the distinct elements only. The new list formed should be in non-decreasing order.Approach:There are two types of heap as we all know that is min heap and max heap Let us first visualize using min heap in order to interpret program execution how union of two linked list is carried on, so de we are having two operations as listed to visualize:Insertion: After inserting all the distinct elements of two linked lists,Removal: Removing the root until minheap is emptyRemoving the root with value 1:Removing the root with value 2:Removing the root with value 3:Removing the root with value 4:Removing the root with value 6:Removing the root with value 8:Removing the root with value 9:Hence we can conclude that in the min-heap, the smallest element will be at the root of the heap, and in the max heap, the greatest element will be at the root of the heap. While implementing the remove() function on heap, the root element will be removed. Since the output should be in increasing order, Min heap can be used. Priority Queue is used to implement min heap in java.  ExampleTime complexity: O(nlogn), Space complexity: O(n)Attention reader! Don’t stop learning now.

Turing Machine Construction (Transducers Turing Machine) in Java,"Prerequisite – Turing MachineTuring Machines can broadly be classified into two types, the Acceptors and the Transducers. Acceptor Turing Machine is an automaton used to define Turing-acceptable languages. Such a machine can be used to check whether a given string belongs to a language or not. It is defined as a 7-tuple machine.Coming to Transducers: In general, transducers are the devices used to convert one form of signal into another. The same can be told about Turing Machine Transducers.A transducer is a type of Turing Machine that is used to convert the given input into the output after the machine performs various read-writes. It doesn’t accept or reject an input but performs series of operations to obtain the output right in the same tape and halts when finished.Few examples of Turing Machine transducers are:Implementation:Now we will be proposing a Java program that was written to simulate the construction and execution performed by turing machine transducers. There are two inputs that must be given while executing it: A .txt file to define the automaton (an example for unary multiplication machine is given after the code), and a string to be entered via the console window which will be the input on tape for the automaton to execute.The .txt file’s path must be given as input. This was done so that the same program can be used for various types of machines instead of hard-coding the automaton. We just need to write a different txt file for generating a different automaton.Java was chosen specifically because of the OOP structure, using which a class was defined for State, Transition, Machine, etc, to be able to encapsulate various aspects of an entity within an object. For example, a transition is defined as a class whose members are three characters – read, write and shift which store read symbol, write a symbol, and shift direction respectively, along with the index of the next state to which the machine should transition to. The same applies to a State object, which stores a list of possible outgoing transitions.Example  The input file that defines symbols, states and transitions for Automaton for Unary multiplication: //lines starting with ‘//’ are ignored by the program while reading so that the input text can be commented//title, will be printed on consoleMACHINE FOR UNARY MULTIPLICATION//input symbols – 1’s for defining unary-number, 0 as delimiter0 1//tape symbols – other than inputsY//blank symbolB//number of states8//start state0//transitions//format – read,write,shift,next state//for state q0, 2 transitions to be read for this state21 B R 10 B R 6//state q120 0 R 21 1 R 1//state q220 0 L 51 Y R 3//state q330 0 R 31 1 R 3B 1 L 4//state q430 0 L 41 1 L 4Y Y R 2//state q540 0 L 51 1 L 5Y 1 L 5B B R 0//state q621 B R 60 B R 7//state q7 – machine halts when it reaches this state as 0 transitions are defined0 Text input for Turing Machine to copy data is given in LINK. Note: The program must be executed on local machine or on an IDE that accepts path for I/O files. Following is how the OUTPUT looks like for Unary Multiplication automaton with “1101110” as input (unary 2 * unary 3) : First part of the output, when machine starts executing on the tape. (after several iterations) After printing all the instances of tape in intervals, machine reaches final state and halts. We can see that “111111” or unary-6 was obtained for 2*3 input. With a bit of effort, the same program can be extended to also work for Acceptor-type Turing machines.

How to Return an Array in Java?,"An array is a data structure that consists of a group of elements of the same data type such that each element of the array can be identified by a single array index or key. The elements of the array are stored in a way that the address of any of the elements can be calculated using the location of the first index of the array using a simple mathematical relation. Arrays in Java are different in implementation and usage when compared to that in C/C++ although they have many similarities as well. Here we will discuss how to return an array in java.In order to return an array in java we need to take care of the following points:Keypoint 1: Method returning the array must have the return type as an array of the same data type as that of the array being returned. The return type may be the usual Integer, Double, Character, String, or user-defined class objects as well.Keypoint 2: Access modifiers must be used accurately considering the usage of the method and the returning array. Static and non-static declarations must also be taken into consideration.Keypoint 3: There must be any variable array of the same data type or something similar at the method call to handle the array being returned. For example, an integer array returned from any method can be stored as follows.Implementation:To better understand this we can look into few different kinds of scenarios where we may be returning arrays. Here we will be considering three examples for scenarios.Case 1: Returning an integer (built-in data type) array in javaAny built-in data type’s array be integer, character, float, double all can be returned simply uses return statements keeping in mind the points listed above. ExampleCase 2: Returning an array of objects in javaThis is done exactly in a similar manner in the case of returning arrays of built-in data types.Example Case 3: Returning multidimensional arrays Multidimensional arrays in java can be said to be an array of arrays inside arrays. The simplest form can be a two-dimensional array. They have their sizes and declaration according to their sizes. Here returning of a two-dimensional array is demonstrated below that has a very similar approach to the one-dimensional arrays.Example  Attention reader! Don’t stop learning now.

How to do syntax checking using PHP ?,"Syntax checking is one of the most important tasks in programming. Our compiler checks our code and shows relevant errors if there is any in the code i.e. compile time, run time, syntax, etc. We can do the same thing i.e. syntax checking in PHP.In this article, we are going to learn how we can do syntax checking in PHP. The syntax is basically a set of rules that defines the structure of a programming language. We can not manually change the syntax and we have to follow the rules of the language.Syntax:We can use –syntax-check in place of -ln, it is more readable.It returns “No syntax errors detected in <filename>” if the provided PHP file has no syntax errors and passed the syntax check. Otherwise, it returns “Errors parsing <filename>” if there is a syntax error in the PHP file.The “-l” or  “–syntax-check” argument performs a syntax check on the given PHP file.Example 1: The following PHP Code is without Syntax error. It finds the sum of two numbers.Command for syntax checking:Output:No Syntax ErrorExample 2: In the above code, we simply replaced the “Sum: “, $z; with  “Sum:, $z; then it throwing a syntax error.Command to do syntax checking:Output:Syntax Error",php,"['Blogathon-2021', 'PHP-Questions', 'Picked', 'Blogathon', 'PHP', 'Web Technologies']",https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-do-syntax-checking-using-php/

If your web server is Wamp, then paste your folder in the folder(C:\wamp\www). Step 02: Directory for the webserverStep 02: Webserver folderStep 3: Create MySQL database.WordPress requires MySQL database.  So, you need to create a database with the username and password on your server (my database username is’ root’ and the password is “ ”). This database may be empty. The database creation window is shown below. Enter a name for the database, then click the Create button. Now the database has been created. Now you can make tables if you want.Step 4: Navigate to the WordPress folder on your web browserLet’s open your web browser and navigate to the WordPress folder(My folder name is FirstWP) in your web server like the following. In my case, the path is localhost/FirstWP(your WordPress folder name). Step 04: Navigate to the web server folder on your browserStep 5: Select LanguageThen you can see a window like the following. Now you need to select the language for your website. I choose English. There are many languages like English, Sinhala, Deutsch, and you can choose the language of your choice. Step 05 : select LanguageAfter selecting language, you can click ‘Continue’ button for continuing the installation process.Step 6: In this step, you can see the following screen. It shows you the database information you already need to know for WordPress installation. There is nothing to change on this page. So you can click the ‘Let’s go!’ Button.   Step 7: Entering Database information. Then you can go next stage. In here you should enter your database details for the following fields. Database Name Enter your MySql database name you have already created in previous step.UserName Enter a username of your databasePassword Enter a  password of your databaseDatabase Host Enter host name. Default host name is localhostTable Prefix It is used to add prefixes to database tables that help to execute several sites in the same database.It takes the default value wp_On the following screen, I have entered information about my database. After entering your database information,  you can click the ‘Submit ‘ button located at the bottom of the screen. Step 8: Before displaying the following screen, WordPress check and confirm your database information which you have entered and display following confirmation snapshot. Then you can click ‘Run the installation’ button to go to the next stage of the installation process. Step 08 : Run as installationStep 9: Now you can see the welcome page below. In this step, you will need to enter the administrative information for your website.  Such as username, password, etc. . Don’t confuse this username, password with the previous one. Previous step we have entered the username & password of the MySQL  Database. Here we create a username and password for logging to  WordPress for creating and modifying the website. In set title field you can give a name for your website which you go to create with WordPress. In the email field, you can give your email address. When you forget your password, it helps to create a new password for your website. After giving all information, you can click ‘install WordPress’ button to install WordPress.   After the installation process is successful, you will get a screen showing that it is successful, as shown in the screenshot below.   Step 10 : Success  PageNow you can click ‘Log In’ button to log for creating your website using WordPress.  Step 10: Logging your website logging window displays like following.

What is the most used method for hashing passwords in PHP ?,"Hashing password is a technique of converting a single password into another string called hashed password. The hashed password is generally one-way, i.e. we can’t go to the original password from the hashed password. So the thing is why we needed to use hashing to do all this stuff, why going one more mile if we can save our passwords into the database as a simple string. The one and only reason for doing all these is to enhance security because the hackers don’t steal credentials from our valuable site. So that’s why we use various hashing methods to hash passwords to secure our passwords while creating websites and storing our database. In PHP, there are various cryptographic algorithms that are commonly used like md5, crypt, sha1, and bcrypt. And the most commonly used nowadays is bcrypt hashing method. In this article, we are going to learn about bcrypt hashing method in PHP.PHP provides a general password hashing function for creating a new password hash from the password.Syntax:Here, the password_hash function takes mainly three parameters that are:Return Value: It returns a hashed password string.Example:Output:Password is: GeeksforGeeksHashed password using CRYPT_BLOWFISH: $2y$10$V4Cvy4caGAQBLWbw8i/PHOK9lopTYoxyQze3aZ3ocw9dDvju7WxoiHashed password using Argon2i: $argon2i$v=19$m=65536,t=4,p=1$Y2F2TVouVWplYVYucy9DSw$p164c28N85L5v1i8GISN1oao10ZzNm9e/JAyicRaX/wHashed password using bcrypt: $2y$10$MQU3vDgoN10.JxyJ1m9UQOEqFy.Jg3D8tmHdZUAAkcpGFRwkbbLfiNote: We have not used PASSWORD_ARGON2ID because it is not available in standard PHP installation.To verify the hashed password: PHP provides an inbuilt function called password_verify to match the hashed password to the original passwords.Syntax:Parameters:Example:",php,['sweetyty'],https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-the-most-used-method-for-hashing-passwords-in-php/
How to Destroy Session After Some Time in PHP ?,"In PHP, we create sessions for the user who is logged in and make that user online till the user log out of that session. It can be done by clicking on the logout button or by destroying that session after a fixed time. By default the expiry time of any particular session that is created is 1440 secs i.e. (24*60) i.e. 24 minutes. But in some cases, we need to change the default time accordingly.We can do that in 2 ways.1. We can change it in the php.ini file, and change the configuration, but that will change the default time for all the sites working on that server and that will be a hindrance to all other sites.So the second option is preferable.2. We can logically change the destroy time of the session. We take the time of the creation of the session by calculating the system current time and as the user browses to different pages of the script will check for the expiry time i.e. is explicitly declared as session-expiry.File Structure:index.php: If you enter wrong credentials it will throw an error, If you enter correct credentials you will be redirected to “HomePage.php” and destroy session after 1 minute.The developer can change the time accordingly.Output:Session destroyAttention reader!

PHP mb_str_split() Function,"The mb_str_split() function was introduced in the release of PHP version 7.4.0 and it is only supported with PHP versions equal to or greater than 7.4.0. The mb_str_split() function serves as an alternate of str_split() function. It is used to split the given string with the specified length of chunks and returns an array on success and FALSE on failure but in PHP 8, it does not return FALSE on failure .Syntax:Parameters:NameTypeDescription$stringstringThe string which is to be splited into chunks and it is required.$lengthintLength of the substring in which the string is being split. It is optional parameter.$encodingstringEncoding format which is to be applied on the substring. It is an optional parameter and default value is null.NameTypeDescription Example 1: In the below example, the word “Awesome” is being split by using mb_str_split() function and since this function returns an array of characters print_r() has been used to print the output.Output:Example 2: In the below example, two variables $sentence and $word has been created. The $sentance is used to store any random sentence of string type whereas $word is used to store the array returned by mb_str_split(). The  basic idea of the code is to separate “GeeksforGeeks” from the sentence which is stored in $sentence. Here, mb_str_split() is used to separate the substring with the specified length and the array is stored in $word and the result is displayed accordingly.Output:Reference: https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.mb-str-split.php",php,"['PHP-function', 'PHP-string', 'PHP', 'Web Technologies']",https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/php-mb_str_split-function/
PHP trigger_error() Function,"The trigger_error() function is an inbuilt function in PHP that has the capacity to act as a built-in error handler. This function is generally used by programmers to trigger or generate user level errors, notices or messages. It returns a Boolean value i.e. it returns TRUE on success and FALSE on failure of the expression.Syntax:Here, $message parameter is the message that is to be displayed and it is of string type whereas $error_level is used to describe the type of error that has to displayed and it is of integer type. For any trigger_error() function, $message is required and $error_level can be optional depending upon the user requirement and the maximum length for $message is 1024 bytes.Example 1: In this example, a user defined function doFunction($var) accepts one value as a parameter inside that function the parameter will be checked if the value will be numeric then $var.”is numeric” will be printed otherwise an error will be thrown with the message “variable must be numeric” and this is done though trigger_error() function.Output:Example 2: By default using a trigger_error() function will generate a PHP Notice however user can also generate PHP errors or PHP warnings by adding parameters within the trigger_error() function as demonstrated in the below example. In this example, we have created a divide function that takes two parameters if the value of $second will be equal to zero, the trigger_error() function will throw a PHP fatal error since in the parameter E_USER_ERROR  is passed along with error message to trigger_error() and if the value for $second will not be equal to zero then $first will be divided by $second and the result will be displayed.Output:Reference: https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.trigger-error.php",php,"['PHP-function', 'PHP', 'Web Technologies']",https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/php-trigger_error-function/
PHP debug_backtrace() Function,"The debug_backtrace() function is an inbuild function in PHP which is generally used by programmers in debugging. The main work of debug_backtrace() function is to generate the PHP backtrace i.e. to examine the stack trace. It returns an array of associate array of the backtrace PHP code. All possible returned elements by this function are –NameTypeDescriptionfunctionstringName of the function in which debug_backtrace() function is being called.lineintegerCurrent line number of the function call.filestringName of the file where debug_backtrace() function has been called.classstringName of the class where debug_backtrace() function has been called.objectobjectName of the object which has been used to evoke the member function in which debug_backtrace() function is present.typestringThe type of current call . If the current call type is method call then , “->” is returned. If it is a static method call then, “::” is returned and If it is a function call then, nothing is returned.argsarrayList of the Arguments present in the function definition. If the debug_backtrace() function is used within the file then all the files included within that is returned. NameTypeDescriptionSyntax:Here, both the parameters $options and $limit are optional and are of integer type. The $option parameter is used for bitmask and $limit can be used to set limit the number of stack frame to be printed. Default value for the $limit is set to zero.Example: In this example, we have created a function that returns the sum of two input parameters and inside that debug_backtrace() function has been used. While printing the output first the sum of the input parameters will be displayed and then the backtrace of the code will be printed. Example 2: In this example, the concept of debug_backtrace() function has been implemented within the class along with the concept of recursion to check it’s back trace. In this example, two class i.e. BaseClass and DerivedClass has been created along with their constructors and inside the constructor of BaseClass debug_backtrace() has been called.

Creating a Safety Net Checker Application in Android,"In this tutorial we will build a SafetyNet checking application which will help us to understand how exactly does Google’s Safetynet Attestation API Functions and also understand JWS resolving in Kotlin to objects, generating a nonce and passing them during API call. Moreover, understanding Safetynet is necessary for every Android App developer because of its security checking mechanism and makes developers rely upon google’s security check implementation which must be taken into reference while building apps that scale.Pre-requisites:SafetyNet is a simple and scalable solution from Google to verify device compatibility and security. For app developers having concerns about their application’s security, Google trusts its Android SafetyNet will be the right answer. With a strong emphasis on security, SafetyNet essentially protects the sensitive data within an application and helps preserve user trust as well as device integrity. SafetyNet is a part of Google Play Services and is independent of the device manufacturer. Therefore, it requires Google Play Services to be enabled on the device for the API to function smoothly.Firstly you need to create a project under GCP and activate Android Device Verification API. Then go to the Credentials section on the platform to get the key, it would be required later for sending attestation request to SafetyNetAttestation API.Basically, create an Empty Application in Android Studio and add the dependencies we will be using for this project. In this, we will use Fragment Navigation and also view binding for handling functionalities of views. For enabling View Binding in your project follow View Binding Guide. Below is the code for the build.gradle file. Now we need to Create 2 Fragments under the MainActivity and can call them as RequestFragment and ResultFragment. Request fragment would have a button to tap on and pull out a request to SafetyAttestationApi for fetching data from it to display in Result fragment. First, create navigation in res named as nav_graph.xml and it should look like this. and add the below code to that file. Below is the code for the nav_graph.xml file.This graph will connect our Request and Result fragment on top of MainActivity and thus the flow of the application can work smoothly.Now we need to add functions in Request.kt to get data from API and then display it in the Result screen. Before implementing logic in Kotlin, We need to prepare layouts as following. Below is the code for the activity_main.xml file. Below is the code for the fragment_request.xml file. Below is the code for the fragment_result.xml file. So as of now, we’re done with basic layouts of the application and ready to implement the logic which the application needs to work on. The request sent on Safetynet API depends on initially the availability of Google Play Services. So the first and foremost thing that needs to be done is setting up the check for the availability of Google Play Services. Then we can send a request to API with a generated nonce which is needed by API to recheck it while data is returned. Data is returned in JsonWebSignature which needs to be parsed into Kotlin object to be displayed. Google suggests verifying returned data by the backend to avoid irregular attacking on the API system. Here we will just test the application and will not implement it by backend which is required to be done while making production-ready applications. Below is the code for the Request.kt file.With this, we generate nonce of 24 bytes and then send a request to API passing none into it and we get data as JsonWebSignature(jws) which we fetch into a SafetynetResultModel which is a simple data class which we parcel to send it across fragments. Below is the code for the SafetynetResultModel.kt file.We parceled the data and send it to the Result fragment by navController which we implemented into nav_graph during the first steps. This way our Result fragment has access to the arguments and thus we can extract data and display it on a simple page. Below is the code for the Result.kt file. We get data with navArgs which is generated by passing the data into navController while navigating between fragments. Similar to passing data into intents. Then displayData() function can display it into the views we created in the layout earlier. This creates a basic SafetyNet application. For creating a production-ready application for distribution. You must add a backend to verify the data returned and check if API is abused or attacked and to prevent it add checks into it.Project Link: Click here",android,"['Android', 'Kotlin']",https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/creating-a-safety-net-checker-application-in-android/
Material Design Component Bottom App Bar in Android,"Material Design Components (MDC Android) offers designers and developers a way to implement Material Design in their Android applications. Developed by a core team of engineers and UX designers at Google, these components enable a reliable development workflow to build beautiful and functional Android applications. Material design in Android is one of the key features that attracts and engages the customer towards the application. This is a special type of design, which is guided by Google. So in this article, it has been demonstrated how to use the Bottom App bar in android. Have a look at the following image to get an overview of the discussion.Create an empty activity projectTo create a new project in Android Studio please refer to How to Create/Start a New Project in Android Studio.Add Required DependencyInclude google material design components dependency in the build.gradle file. After adding the dependencies don’t forget to click on the “Sync Now” button present at the top right corner. Note that the Navigation Rail is introduced in the latest release of the material design components version that is 1.4.0 and above.implementation ‘com.google.android.material:material:1.4.0’Note that while syncing your project you need to be connected to the network and make sure that you are adding the dependency to the app-level Gradle file as shown below.The bottom app bar provides easy access to the navigation drawer and up to four primary actions of the current activity including the Floating Action Button. By including this component in the application provides a huge response to the User Experience because, the user shouldn’t have to stretch their fingers to touch the primary actions on the top of the screen whereas by including this, the user can easily click on primary actions and access the navigation drawer.In the above anatomy taking the example of an e-commerce application, one can see the primary action here is search and also the cart icon may be the primary action for the current screen so the cart can also be included beside the search icon.Step 1: Creating menu items for Bottom App BarCreating a separate menu for Bottom App Bar so that we can make what items should appear on the bar and what items should appear under the Overflow menu control. To implement the sample menu invoke the following in the bottom_app_bar_menu.xml file under the menus folder.Step 2: Working with activity_main.xml fileThe main layout of this sample contains one floating action button which is anchored to Bottom App Bar, which in turn both the views should be under the CoordinatorLayout otherwise error will occur. And the size of the Floating Action Button should be auto. To implement the same invoke the following code inside the activity_main.xml file.Output UI:The above diagram is an example of the Bottom App Bar with the Floating Action Button. However, the Floating action button is optional. To implement the Bottom App Bar without floating action button without the Floating Action Button invoke the following code in the activity_main.xml file.Output UI:Step 3: Working with MainActivity.kt fileIn the MainActivity.kt file there is a need to handle the buttons and the hamburger icon to perform the appropriate actions. Upon clicking the hamburger icon Navigation Drawer needs to be shown. To know how to implement Navigation Drawer refer to Navigation Drawer in Android, upon clicking the search icon the search screen should appear, etc. To implement the same invoke the following code inside the MainActivity.kt file.Output:",android,"['Android', 'Kotlin']",https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/material-design-component-bottom-app-bar-in-android/
LiveData vs ObservableField in Android,"LiveData helps to reduce memory leaks and manual lifecycle handling. It also ensures that UI is always up to date with the data even when the app’s activity is restarted while we are still using our app. It is a part of the architecture patterns of android. It is used for observing changes in the view and updating the view when it is ACTIVE. Thus, LiveData is lifecycle aware.An observable class that holds a parcelable object (allows objects to read and write from Parcels which can contain flattened data inside message containers). An object wrapper to make it observable. ObservableField classes may be used instead of creating an Observable object. If your object class has fewer properties to be updated or if you don’t want to observe every field in the object, you can use ObservableFields to update the UI. You can declare the variable as ObservableField and when the new data is set, the UI will be updated.Unlike objects that implement Observable—such as observable fields—LiveData objects know about the lifecycle of the observers subscribed to the data changes. This knowledge enables many benefits, which are explained in The advantages of using LiveData. In Android Studio version 3.1 and higher, you can replace observable fields with LiveData objects in your data binding code. There are situations where you might prefer to use a View Model component that implements the Observable interface over using LiveData objects, even if you lose the lifecycle management capabilities of LiveData. Using a View Model component that implements Observable gives you more control over the binding adapters in your app. For example, this pattern gives you more control over the notifications when data changes, it also allows you to specify a custom method to set the value of an attribute in two-way data binding.Now, let’s understand ObservableField and why LiveData was required even when ObservableField was present.ViewModel + LiveData + Data Binding = Reactive UIYou can use LiveData all the time, as long as there is a Lifecycle Owner to observe. I prefer to keep bound fields that are only relevant to the ViewModel as Observable and use LiveData for fields whose state changes are also relevant to the Activity or Fragment.",android,"['Picked', 'Android']",https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/livedata-vs-observablefield-in-android/

Material Design Component Navigation Rail in Android,"Material Design Components (MDC Android) offers designers and developers a way to implement Material Design in their Android applications. Developed by a core team of engineers and UX designers at Google, these components enable a reliable development workflow to build beautiful and functional Android applications. Material design in Android is one of the key features that attracts and engages the customer towards the application. This is a special type of design, which is guided by Google. So in this article, it has been demonstrated how to use Navigation Rail in android. Have a look at the following image to get an overview of the discussion.Create an empty activity projectTo create a new project in Android Studio please refer to How to Create/Start a New Project in Android Studio.Add Required DependencyInclude google material design components dependency in the build.gradle file. After adding the dependencies don’t forget to click on the “Sync Now” button present at the top right corner. Note that the Navigation Rail is introduced in the latest release of the material design components version that is 1.4.0 and above.implementation ‘com.google.android.material:material:1.4.0’Note that while syncing your project you need to be connected to the network and make sure that you are adding the dependency to the app-level Gradle file as shown below.Navigation rail provides movement between the primary screens or destination of the application. This basically is a side navigation component that displays a minimum of three to a maximum of seven destinations. Each destination has an associated icon and label. The navigation rail is used for larger screens like tablets and desktop screens.As it is said the Navigation Rail is only ideal for the larger screens, and when the application product has top-level destinations that are easily accessible and these destinations can be main destinations or the screens of the application product. Navigation Rail shouldn’t be used for the applications which are implemented for the smaller size screens and the application shouldn’t possess one or two top-level destinations, it should have a minimum of three and a maximum of seven destinations.The Navigation Rail is placed on the left side of the screen for Left To Right (LTR) languages and right for Right To Left (RTL) languages.Anatomy of the Navigation RailStep 1: Creating menu with icons for the Navigation RailThe menu for Navigation Rail contains four sample items files, images, music, videos also associated icons for each label. To implement the same invoke the following code inside the navigation_rail_menu.xml file, under the menu folder.Step 2: Creating Floating Action Button layout for Navigation RailHowever, this is optional to include the floating action button for the navigation rail. To include the Floating Action Button we have to create a separate single view layout and it should only contain the Floating Action Button as root view, and also the Floating Action Button size should be auto. To implement the same invoke the following code inside the navigation_rail_fab.xml file, under the layout folder.Step 3: Working with activity_main.xml fileThe main and only layout of the file contains the Navigation Rail and attaching the navigation_rail_menu.xml and navigation_rail_fab to it. To implement the same invoke the following code inside the activity_main.xml file.Output UI:Step 4: Working with MainActivity.kt fileIn the MainActivity.kt file we need to handle the click listener for all the items in the Navigation Rail container. Upon clicking these items the simple toast message appears. To implement the same invoke the following code inside MainActivity.kt file.Output:",android,"['Blogathon-2021', 'Android', 'Blogathon', 'Kotlin']",https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/material-design-component-navigation-rail-in-android/
Data Binding with ViewModel in Android,"Prerequisite:What is the benefit of integrating data binding in ViewModel? Simply we can say, It provides easy communication between VIEW and its data (or can say View’s Data). As we know the Views are defined in XML files and the XML file are linked with their activity or fragment file, but their data are stored in ViewModel objects. So if the data wants to communicate with the Views, the Activity or Fragment file will act as an intermediator. This will also increase the productivity of developers as it reduces boilerplate codes. So, In this article will we get to how to connect the Views and their Data directly which is there in ViewModel objects.We will learn this by creating a simple app using Kotlin. Create an app with an empty activity. As we are using Data binding we need to enable Data Binding in build.gradle fileCreate a ViewModel classNow we need to create a layout in XML and create a variable in the XML layout. Using data tag we declare a variable. Now, we need to create a binding object in Activity, to pass the data to the variable which we defined in XML layout and MainViewModel object as a data source for the Views.Output:Our app is ready and it’s also working as we can see the data in form of text which was stored in the ViewModel object. So, we got to know how we directly communicate the View with its Data without taking the help of any intermediate. But, in this app, there is one issue as if we click the UPDATE TEXT button the text won’t be updated as expected, but it will remain the same. This is because we need to set the change text ( Data ) again to the View for any new data changes, so we need to define a function in the Activity file to Update the view. But we don’t want the communicate the View with Activity. So here we can use Live Data, Simply we can say, Live data is observer data holder class. If we declare any data as LiveData, then the data can be observed by Android components like Activity, Fragments, etc. Therefore, if we declare any data as Live Data and bind it using view binding to a View, then whenever the data changes the View gets automatically gets updated. In this article, we have discussed only Data binding with ViewModel and in the next article, we will also see Data Binding with LiveData.",android,"['Android', 'Kotlin']",https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/data-binding-with-viewmodel-in-android/
Different ways to apply colors in an HTML document,"A colorful website or application is more attractive rather than a black and white website. In this article, we will go through all the different ways to apply colors in HTML documents. Like other HTML tags, there is no special tag to apply colors in HTML documents. However, using the style attribute, you can make a particular element colorful and appealing. We will also discuss color coding methods that will help you to apply the same color using different methods.There are two main properties in style attribute to set the color of text and background of the block. Example 1: We can use text attribute to set the color of text and bg-color to set the background color. Output:           Moreover, to set color for the linked text, the style attribute has 3 different properties.Different color coding methods in HTML: There are mainly three different color coding methods available in HTML language. Hexadecimal and RGB notation are the most popular methods. However, some developers are also using the color name notation and HSL notation.HTML Colors:Example 2: We use the color name to set the color of text, link, or background. On the internet, You will find more than 200 colors with their name. We have a list of W3C standard 16 colors. Output:              HTML colors Hexadecimal notation: Instead of writing color names, we will write the hexadecimal codes to set the particular color. There is a unique hexadecimal code available for every color. Hexadecimal code is a string of 6 characters followed by the # sign. It includes values from 0 to 9 and A to Z.HTML colors RGB notation: RGB stands for the Red, Green, and Blue. It takes three integer values between 0 to 255 for each one among three colors. By changing the values of the three inputs, you can produce new colors which you need. HTML colors HSL notation: HSL notation is rarely used by HTML developers. HSL is referred to as Hue, Saturation, and Lightness. For the hue, we have to set a value in degree between 0 to 360. For the saturation and lightness, we have to set values in percentage between 0% to 100%.Different ways to apply color: The most preferable method to set color inside the HTML document is using the stylesheet. If needed, we can use inline CSS or internal CSS. We will see each method one by one.Inline CSS: As the name suggests, we have to add a style attribute inside any HTML tag. Inside the style attribute, we can add color properties and their value.Internal CSS: We have to add color properties inside the HTML file but not inside the HTML tag. HTML code: The following code has internal CSS code.External CSS: This method is the same as the internal CSS method but we have to add CSS in the external file.HTML code:color.css: The following code is used in the above HTML code.Conclusion: Users can create a colorful application using the different color coding methods. We recommended using the color name and hexadecimal notation because some browser does not support RGB and HSL notation. To pick a hexadecimal code or RGB value, you can use a color picker that you find on the internet.Attention reader! Don’t stop learning now.

How to include frameset inside another frameset in HTML ?,"The frameset is the collection of frames in the browser window. It is used to specify the number of rows and columns in a frameset with their pixels of space. There are some real-world applications of frameset like while making the website for any purpose, the developer first makes the design of the whole website where he divides the whole website into some frames such that each frame has some function. Let’s take an example of a news website, there are various sections like trending, latest, business, cricket news, etc and there is also a slider in some websites which scrolls the image after some seconds. In this article, we will discuss for creating a nested frameset or a frameset inside another frameset.

How to create dismissible alerts in Bootstrap ?,"Alerts are a very important component in the Bootstrap library. They are used to display any message to the users like a form being submitted, OTP is sent or incorrect input entered in the form. In other words, alerts are used to provide feedback messages to the user based on their interaction with the website.In this article, we will learn how to create a dismissible alert using the bootstrap library. Dismissible alerts make our website like a modern website where we can dismiss the alert after reading it. We will need to load the alert plugin by including the compiled Bootstrap JavaScript on our HTML page.We can add the close button and use the .alert-dismissible class, which adds extra padding to the right of the alert and positions the close button. On the close button, we use the data-bs-dismiss=”alert” attribute, which triggers the JavaScript functionality. The <button> element is recommended here for proper behavior across all devices. We can use the .fade and .show classes to animate alerts when they are dismissed.Syntax:Example:Output:Attention reader! Don’t stop learning now.

How to link jQuery in HTML page ?,"jQuery is one of the most popularly used JavaScript Libraries out there which is a lot easier to use than standard JavaScript as it provides many built-in functions to access. It is build using JavaScript capabilities, you are able to use all the functions that are available in JavaScript. In this article, we will discuss how to link jQuery to the HTML page. There are two ways through which you can include the jQuery file in HTML code: Downloading the jQuery Library: In this method, we directly download the library through the website on our system. Basically, there are two versions to download:-We will use the development version for our purpose. Just follow through these steps to download the jQuery on your system –        Now let’s link it to our HTML code.

How to turn off spell checking for HTML form elements ?,"You may have noticed often that while filling a form in any website if we made any spelling or grammatical mistake it would get underlined by a red wavy line. It is sometimes annoying for the user as he/she may get distracted by it. So, many websites turn off the Spell Check Feature for their users. The Spell Check feature in HTML is used to identify grammatical or spelling mistakes made by the user while giving the input in the form. In this article, we will discuss how to turn off the spell check feature for the HTML form elementSpell Check feature can be enabled/disabled using an attribute called spellcheck which defines whether the HTML element will be checked for the errors or not. It takes two values, either true or false. When you give the value as true, it will be turned on and will check for any grammatical/ spelling errors present in the field, and when the value is given false, it will get turned off and will not check for any errors. The spellcheck attribute supports all the HTML form elements.Syntax:For Input Field: For Text Area Field:Now let’s see an example of how to turn it off by writing an HTML code for the same.Output: You can notice in both the fields that there is one red wavy line under the words of the first column showing the grammatical errors because spellcheck is true in this field whereas in the text area the spell check is false that’s no red wavy line is not appear under the wrong words.Attention reader!

How to we create Pagination in Materialize CSS ?,"Materialize CSS is a front-end UI library that is created by Google using the combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is basically a design language that combines classic design along with modern innovations and technology. The purpose of Google behind developing Materialize CSS is to provide a unified system design for all their products across the internet. Materialize CSS is also known as Material Design.In this article, we will discuss one such very useful component that can be found in almost all the websites, i.e. pagination. Pagination is seen in multiple websites and the most common example is doing Google Search. You can see the pagination tab like the one shown above at the bottom of every Google search page. Pagination helps to display a huge amount of data in a better way. Let’s understand this with the help of an example: Suppose you have searched for mobile phones on the Amazon website, now, Amazon has thousands of mobile phones to display which cannot be displayed on a single screen and if it displays all the options a single web page, it will become very long and the user has to do a very hectic scrolling and gives the user or customer a very bad experience. Instead of that, we can display suppose 20 mobile phones on each page and make pagination at the end so that the user can navigate through them.Now, let’s understand how to use pagination by using Materialize CSS. Let’s add the Pagination code for this page with the following syntax. Syntax:Now, by default, all the button does not have any URL are not linked to any page. We can link each of the page buttons with a different page and also increase or decrease the no. of pages by either increasing or decreasing the no. of list items.Now, here is an example of basic pagination that we have created with 4 pages:Example: In the below example, we will be creating 3 files that can be accessed using navigation.Output:Attention reader!

How to load more feature using jQuery ?,"Bootstrap provides a lot of useful features that we generally integrate into our websites. One of them is the “Load More” feature which we can see on every second website we visit. The load more feature is used to load more or show more content available on the webpage to the visitor. Initially, half of the content is hidden, only some part of it is visible to the visitor. And when the Load More Button is clicked, the remaining content appears. This feature also gives the website a clean look. This is a pretty cool feature you must try on your website. Approach: The Load More feature of bootstrap can be integrated on the website by including a particular script (given below) and few javascript libraries, in the code. This script divides all the elements corresponding to a particular class, into parts withsize according to the slice function and displays the different parts one after another on clicking the load more button on the screen. And when the size becomes zero i.e. no more elements are left, it displays the text “No more to view”.   Let’s see the step-by-step implementation of how to integrate the Load More feature into the website step by step.Step 1: You just need to include the following script on your website to make the “load more” button work. Here, .block is the class of the items in the HTML code, on which we will be applying the Load More feature and #load is the id of the Load more button. Step 2: Also need to include the following javascript libraries in your HTML file as scripts.<script src=”https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.2.1/jquery.min.js”></script><script src=”https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.12.1/jquery-ui.min.js”></script>Example:Output:Explanation: In this example, only one paragraph was visible in the output initially, and with every click to load more button, one more successive paragraph appears, this is because in the slice function we mentioned (0,1) this time.Attention reader!

What is local installation ?,"Local installation involves the downloading of static files like CSS locally on our system and then using them on our web page. This ensures that the given copy of CSS is loaded from our local machine. This is different than using CSS files hosted on a CDN where the files will be loaded by making a call to the CDN.There are numerous use cases where a local installation is needed. We can develop our applications without the internet as the CSS files are already present on our system. This can also reduce the dependency on third-party CDNs that may change the version of the file that is hosted on the given URL. Having a local copy also allows us to make changes to the file if the need arises.In the below example, we will download the latest version of Bootstrap and copy the files to our local system. We will then include these files inside our project folder using the <link> tag. Example:Output:Reference: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bootstrap-tutorialsAttention reader! Don’t stop learning now.

How to load more feature using jQuery ?,"Bootstrap provides a lot of useful features that we generally integrate into our websites. One of them is the “Load More” feature which we can see on every second website we visit. The load more feature is used to load more or show more content available on the webpage to the visitor. Initially, half of the content is hidden, only some part of it is visible to the visitor. And when the Load More Button is clicked, the remaining content appears. This feature also gives the website a clean look. This is a pretty cool feature you must try on your website. Approach: The Load More feature of bootstrap can be integrated on the website by including a particular script (given below) and few javascript libraries, in the code. This script divides all the elements corresponding to a particular class, into parts withsize according to the slice function and displays the different parts one after another on clicking the load more button on the screen. And when the size becomes zero i.e. no more elements are left, it displays the text “No more to view”.   Let’s see the step-by-step implementation of how to integrate the Load More feature into the website step by step.Step 1: You just need to include the following script on your website to make the “load more” button work. Here, .block is the class of the items in the HTML code, on which we will be applying the Load More feature and #load is the id of the Load more button. Step 2: Also need to include the following javascript libraries in your HTML file as scripts.<script src=”https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.2.1/jquery.min.js”></script><script src=”https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.12.1/jquery-ui.min.js”></script>Example:Output:Explanation: In this example, only one paragraph was visible in the output initially, and with every click to load more button, one more successive paragraph appears, this is because in the slice function we mentioned (0,1) this time.Attention reader!

How to represent a variable in Less ?,LESS stands for Leaner Style Sheets. It is a backward-compatible language extension for CSS. One of its features is that it lets you use variables in the style sheet. Variables can be used to store CSS values that may be reused. This makes it easier for the user by letting them define commonly used values in a single location.Defining a variable: Variables in Less are represented with an at (@) sign. We can assign a value using a colon (:). Using a variable as values to properties:Using a variable as parameters to functions:The below examples demonstrate the use of Less variables.Example 1:  File name style.css which we get after pre-compiling style.lessOutput:Example 2:File name style.css which we get after pre-compiling style.lessOutput:Without hovering,css,"['CSS-Questions', 'HTML-Questions', 'Picked', 'SASS', 'CSS', 'Web Technologies']",https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-represent-a-variable-in-less/
Different ways to apply colors in an HTML document,"A colorful website or application is more attractive rather than a black and white website. In this article, we will go through all the different ways to apply colors in HTML documents. Like other HTML tags, there is no special tag to apply colors in HTML documents. However, using the style attribute, you can make a particular element colorful and appealing. We will also discuss color coding methods that will help you to apply the same color using different methods.There are two main properties in style attribute to set the color of text and background of the block. Example 1: We can use text attribute to set the color of text and bg-color to set the background color. Output:           Moreover, to set color for the linked text, the style attribute has 3 different properties.Different color coding methods in HTML: There are mainly three different color coding methods available in HTML language. Hexadecimal and RGB notation are the most popular methods. However, some developers are also using the color name notation and HSL notation.HTML Colors:Example 2: We use the color name to set the color of text, link, or background. On the internet, You will find more than 200 colors with their name. We have a list of W3C standard 16 colors. Output:              HTML colors Hexadecimal notation: Instead of writing color names, we will write the hexadecimal codes to set the particular color. There is a unique hexadecimal code available for every color. Hexadecimal code is a string of 6 characters followed by the # sign. It includes values from 0 to 9 and A to Z.HTML colors RGB notation: RGB stands for the Red, Green, and Blue. It takes three integer values between 0 to 255 for each one among three colors. By changing the values of the three inputs, you can produce new colors which you need. HTML colors HSL notation: HSL notation is rarely used by HTML developers. HSL is referred to as Hue, Saturation, and Lightness. For the hue, we have to set a value in degree between 0 to 360. For the saturation and lightness, we have to set values in percentage between 0% to 100%.Different ways to apply color: The most preferable method to set color inside the HTML document is using the stylesheet. If needed, we can use inline CSS or internal CSS. We will see each method one by one.Inline CSS: As the name suggests, we have to add a style attribute inside any HTML tag. Inside the style attribute, we can add color properties and their value.Internal CSS: We have to add color properties inside the HTML file but not inside the HTML tag. HTML code: The following code has internal CSS code.External CSS: This method is the same as the internal CSS method but we have to add CSS in the external file.HTML code:color.css: The following code is used in the above HTML code.Conclusion: Users can create a colorful application using the different color coding methods. We recommended using the color name and hexadecimal notation because some browser does not support RGB and HSL notation. To pick a hexadecimal code or RGB value, you can use a color picker that you find on the internet.Attention reader! Don’t stop learning now.

How to we create Pagination in Materialize CSS ?,"Materialize CSS is a front-end UI library that is created by Google using the combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is basically a design language that combines classic design along with modern innovations and technology. The purpose of Google behind developing Materialize CSS is to provide a unified system design for all their products across the internet. Materialize CSS is also known as Material Design.In this article, we will discuss one such very useful component that can be found in almost all the websites, i.e. pagination. Pagination is seen in multiple websites and the most common example is doing Google Search. You can see the pagination tab like the one shown above at the bottom of every Google search page. Pagination helps to display a huge amount of data in a better way. Let’s understand this with the help of an example: Suppose you have searched for mobile phones on the Amazon website, now, Amazon has thousands of mobile phones to display which cannot be displayed on a single screen and if it displays all the options a single web page, it will become very long and the user has to do a very hectic scrolling and gives the user or customer a very bad experience. Instead of that, we can display suppose 20 mobile phones on each page and make pagination at the end so that the user can navigate through them.Now, let’s understand how to use pagination by using Materialize CSS. Let’s add the Pagination code for this page with the following syntax. Syntax:Now, by default, all the button does not have any URL are not linked to any page. We can link each of the page buttons with a different page and also increase or decrease the no. of pages by either increasing or decreasing the no. of list items.Now, here is an example of basic pagination that we have created with 4 pages:Example: In the below example, we will be creating 3 files that can be accessed using navigation.Output:Attention reader!

Explain the positions property in CSS,"In this article, we will see what is position property, how to use this property wisely in order to make web pages. The position property is used to align the different elements in the HTML page. Position Property plays an important role to make high-quality web pages.There are 5 position properties in CSS:Syntax:Let’s understand each of these properties one by one. 1. position: static It is the default position value for the element. Under static position, elements positioned according to the normal flow of the page.Note: left, right, top, and bottom properties will not affect if position is static.Example:Output:2. Position: Relative In this case, the element remains in the normal flow of the document but left, right, top, and bottom affects. Elements get shifted from their original position in the document creating vacant space and other elements may adjust themselves according to the vacant space left by the element. Example:Output:Explanation: We can see here element change its left and top from the original position creating some space.3. position: absolute Absolute elements do not follow the normal flow document instead they position themselves relative to the closest positioned ancestor. Its final position is determined using the top, bottom,  left and right.Note: The positioned element means element having position property other than static.These element does not occupy any space and other elements treats absolute elements like there is no element. Parent element should be positioned and position property other than absolute and If parent element is not positioned then absolute element position themselves according to nearest positioned ancestor. We generally set z-index when using absolute position. Consider Two cases to understand absolute position:1st case: When parent property value is positioned means position property of parent is not equal to static.Output:Explanation: Here we can see child element has adjusted itself according to parent and no extra space is assign to it.2nd Case: When parent element is not positioned.Output:Explanation: As the parent is not positioned, the child element will try to adjust itself relative to nearest positioned ancestor. Here nearest positioned ancestor is <HTML> so element gets adjust according to <HTML>.4. position: Fixed Fixed element does not follow normal document flow and position themselves relative to <HTML> tag. This element always stick to the screen. Example:Output:You can see the fixed element remain at its position even after scrolling up and down. 5. position: sticky It’s kind of little tricky but very easy to understand. We can think of sticky as combination of relative and fixed. Remember in fixed element remain fixed at some position but in sticky element will behave like relative to certain point and after behave like fixed.Example:Output:Explanation: In the above output, you can see the sticky element behaves like a relative element until it reaches a particular offset. Then beyond that point, it sticks to the page and behaves like fixed (here that offset is 10px from top).Note: In sticky left, right, top and bottom does not determine the position of the element in the relative state but it specifies at what position element should behave like fixed.Attention reader!

SQL Query to Compare Two Dates,"In SQL, dates are complicated for newbies, since while working with the database, the format of the date in the table must be matched with the input date in order to insert. In various scenarios instead of date, DateTime (time is also involved with date) is used. Here we will see, SQL Query to compare two dates. This can be easily done using equals to(=), less than(<), and greater than(>) operators. In SQL, the date value has DATE datatype which accepts date in ‘yyyy-mm-dd’ format. To compare two dates, we will declare two dates and compare them using the IF-ELSE statement.Syntax: IF Boolean_expression       { sql_statement | statement_block }  [ ELSE       { sql_statement | statement_block } ]  We can declare variables easily by using the keyword DECLARE before the variable name.

Remove All Spaces From a String in SQL Server,"There are scenarios of the occurrence of spaces before and after a string and we may need to remove/trim the spaces for our use. Let us see how it is getting handled in SQL Server. Till SQL Server 2016, we have the functions called SQL LTRIM and SQL RTRIM functions. The name itself implies that LTRIM is helpful to remove the leftmost spaces and RTRIM is helpful to remove the rightmost spaces.From SQL Server 2017 onwards, we have TRIM() function also which trim both leading and trailing characters together with a single function. In this article, let us cover them in detail.It removes the spaces from the beginning of the string. We may be having spaces before and after the string. By using LTRIM() function, we can remove leftmost spaces. Let us use DATALENGTH() function to calculate data length in bytes before and after using SQL LTRIM function. Combining all these, let us see with the below exampleQuery: Output:It removes the spaces from the end(starting from the right side) of the string. We may be having spaces before and after the string. By using RTRIM() function, we can remove the rightmost spaces. Let us use DATALENGTH() function to calculate data length in bytes before and after using SQL RTRIM function. Combining all these, let us see with the below exampleQuery:Output:From SQL Server 2017 onwards, we have TRIM() functionality also. It removes the beginning spaces as well as end spaces of the string.Query:Output:We can use the above 3 functionalities to remove the spaces according to the requirement.

How to avoid callback hell in Node.js ?,"Callback hell in Node.js is the situation in which we have complex nested callbacks. In this, each callback takes arguments that have been obtained as a result of previous callbacks. This kind of callback structure leads to lesser code readability and maintainability.We can avoid the callback hell with the help of Promises. Promises in javascript are a way to handle asynchronous operations in Node.js. It allows us to return a value from an asynchronous function like synchronous functions. When we return something from an asynchronous method it returns a promise which can be used to consume the final value when it is available in the future with the help of then() method or await inside of async functions. The syntax to create a promise is mentioned below.Example: In the code example mentioned below, we simulate an asynchronous add operation with the help of setTimeout(). Output:",node.js,"['NodeJS-Questions', 'Picked', 'Node.js', 'Web Technologies']",https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-avoid-callback-hell-in-node-js/

How to check the version of ReactJS ?,"React is a Javascript front-end library that is used to build single-page applications (SPA). If we want to know which react version we are using to build a project then there are some easy ways to find it.In this article, we are going to discuss three ways to find out the React version.Using package.json fileThe package.json contains metadata about our project. It is created by default when we create our React project. We can create a react app using the command mentioned below. The package.json file contains a lot of information in the name/value pairs in JSON format. We can easily check our React version under the list of dependencies as shown in the image given below.Using command lineWe can easily check the React version by using the command mentioned below on our command line.The output demonstrating the use of the above command on the command line is mentioned below.Using version property of default import from ReactThe default import from React library is an object that has version property on it. We can use this property inside our JSX elements in our desired manner. Syntax: The syntax to use the version property is mentioned below.To follow along with the article create a react project using the command that was discussed above in the article. Filename: App.js The content of the App.js file is mentioned in the code given below in which we have demonstrated the use of version property on React object.Step to run the application: Use the following command on the command line to start the application.Output: Open the browser and go to http://localhost:3000, you will see the following output.",reactjs,"['Picked', 'React-Questions', 'ReactJS', 'Web Technologies']",https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-check-the-version-of-reactjs/
How to use CSS in different dimension (CSS-in-JS) ?,"Today we will see about CSS-in-JavaScript. CSS is awesome and easy to get started with, but front-end applications have been scaling at a massive and complex rate that doesn’t make the current CSS designed for the job. CSS-in-JS is a real deal and in many ways, is very much the best nowadays when it comes to building and styling applications on the web.What is CSS-in-JS: Just as the name implies, CSS-in-Javascript. It is still CSS but it leverages JavaScript capabilities. It uses JavaScript as a language to describe styles in a declarative and maintainable way.Benefits of CSS-in-JS:When to use CSS-in-JS: A beginner who just wants to create websites without a dynamic front-end might find the standard CSS the best option for styling. But for developers who are working on a component-heavy javascript project, CSS-in-JS is the best option for you.To implement CSS in JS: We cannot use CSS-in-JS without CSS-in-JS libraries. There are a lot of CSS-in-JS libraries Let’s see how to use CSS in JS with the help of these libraries with examples.Creating React Application:Step 1: Create a React application using the following command:Step 2: Now, navigate to the ‘form’ folder by writing the below commands in the command prompt terminal. Project Structure: It will look like the following. Step 3: Type the below command to run your project on the browser localhost: 30001. Styled Components: It is one of the most popular CSS-in-JS libraries presented on Github. It has 23K+ stars on GitHub. With styled-components, you create a normal React component with your styles attached to it. Styled-component has awesome features like no class name bugs, painless maintenance. The steps on how to work with styled-components is sown below: Step 1: Install the required library using the following command in your terminal:Step 2: Now the installation is done. Write down the following code in the App.js file. Here is an example of how to style with a CSS-in JS library styled-component.

What are the three principles that Redux follows ?,"Back in time when the buzz about app development had just started, frontend was easy to achieve. However, with an increasing focus on end-user experience, the complexity of the craft frontend is rising and becoming overwhelming.To meet new-age users’ pressing and evolving demands, frontend developers look at Vue to help them get over the woes of complexity. In addition to this, Angular and React are possible choices. However, frontend applications lack consistency, which endured the need for a stable container for JavaScript applications. As a result, redux was developed to help frontend developers write applications for consistent behaviour. In addition to this, redux also helps tackle the React performance issues. As a result, Redux is constant when it comes to running in different environments–native, server, and client. Usually, Redux works with React to eliminate issues encountered with the state management in massive applications. Furthermore, since React is troublesome to resume components as it is tightly coupled with the root components, redux helps reduce the complexity. In addition to this, it also offers global accessibility for building easy-to-test applications.Get to the basics first if you are just getting started with redux and want to explore it in detail.In order to understand the core of redux, you only need to know three principles. Creating React Application as well as Installing Module:Step 1: Initially, create a React app using the below-mentioned command:Step 2: Once you create the folder with the appropriate folder name–Principle–and go along with it with the following command:Step 3: Once you are done creating the ReactJS application, install the modules with the below-mentioned command:Project Structure: It will look like the following:Example: In the below example, we begin with the data layer by storing information. As per the first principle, Redux is a singular store for data sharing. Hence, we will start with creating a singleton for storage. According to the second principle, the pure functions have a characteristic to be predictable. These functions will not have any database calls or network calls. When we will call pure functions using the same argument or parameter sets, the same value will be returned.  The following code is to be written in App.js. In addition to this, we will connect view layer to state layer with React-Redux. In the code below, the previous state will change when an action is triggered by the user, which means that upon will return to the new state.As per the principle, the entire state of your application can be represented as a unified JavaScript object. The following data will be stored in cricketerReducer.js.Step to run the application: Open the terminal and type the following command.Output: Open the browser and move to http://localhost:3000/ to view the following output.",reactjs,"['Picked', 'React-Questions', 'ReactJS', 'Web Technologies']",https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-are-the-three-principles-that-redux-follows/

React.js Pokémon App.,"Introduction: In this article, we will be going to see how to Build a Pokémon App using React.js and Pokémon API.Pre-requisite:Approach: This web app is going to be a one-paged web app where we are going show to different types of Pokémon and some of their features will also be mentioned there, we will get all these data using a free API resource https://pokeapi.co/. We will set a Load More button, clicking that button the page will load more Pokémon on our webpage (no. of  Pokémon will depend on the limit value that we would have set in our API call ).Now let’s see the step-by-step implementation of the above approach. Creating the react app and installing all the required packages:Step 1: Create a React application using the following command:Step 2: After creating your project folder i.e. foldername, move to it using the following command:Project Structure: It will look like the following.file explorerIgnore the build folder for now, when you will be done with making this app, if you want to deploy your app somewhere then you have to run “npm run build” in your terminal which will create a build folder. Then you just simply need to drag and drop that build folder in your deploying website https://www.netlify.com/.Step 3: Now inside src folder, edit your App.js. For loadPoke you can set any limit that you want, here I have set the limit as 20. In this file we are using two useState hooks container one for fetching all the data with their name using https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/${pokemon.name} within the useEffect and and another one is for loading more Pokémon on onClick event of More Pokemons button fetching the API https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon?limit=20. Then within the  Pokémon app container, we are structuring the whole Pokémon card with required characteristics and setting the props for other components. Step 4: Now inside the src folder, make a Components folder, make two files within this folder one for the Pokémon thumbnail and another one is  for the description.  In your src/Components/PokemonThumnail.js(or whatever name you like to give) paste the code given below. In this file, we are using all the required props which have been passed by the App.js and creating the whole Pokémon thumbnail structure. Here we have useState for show to show the Descripton.js component on clicking the Load More buttons by default it has been set as false .Step 5: Paste the code given below in your src/Components/Description.js(or whatever name you will give). In this file, we are making a component for giving the description about the Pokémon, here also we are using props that have been passed by App.js. There is a know more button in our Pokémon thumbnail, on clicking that particular button this description will be shown in our Thumbnail UI, and on clicking Know less thumbnail will show its initial state.   Step 6: Go to your src/index.css , paste the code given below , this will add styling to your Pokémon web app for all the components.Step to Run Application: Run the application using the following command from the root directory of the project:Output: Now open your browser and go to http://localhost:3000/, you will see the following output:",reactjs,"['CSS-Questions', 'JavaScript-Questions', 'React-Questions', 'JavaScript', 'ReactJS', 'Web Technologies']",https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/react-js-pokemon-app/
How to deploy simple frontend server-less (static) React applications on Netlify,"Netlify is one of the most popular hosting services that specialize in hosting server-less services for web applications and static websites. It is a web development program that quadruples productivity. By unifying the elements of the modern decoupled web, from local development to advanced edge logic, Netlify enables a faster path to much more performant, secure, and scalable websites and apps. Therefore it is not a stretch to say that it is one of the best services out there for hosting frontend React applications that may or may not have a dedicated database or backend.Pre-requisites for this task:Now we will create a dummy React application using the following steps. Creating React Application:Step 1: Create a React application using the following command:Step 2: After creating your project folder i.e. foldername, move to it using the following command:Project Structure: It will look like the following.Dummy React app project structureThis is how the structure of the newly created React application will look like. As you can see, React, being user-friendly, creates a dummy template for us to use so that we can make changes and add more javascript components with ease. You can easily create a simple calculator application or rock-paper-scissors and that too, without ever needing to create a node server, this is what it means to be a server-less(static) application or website. Here, we should only concern ourselves with two of these files that have been created namely App.js and index.js. The App.js file is referred to as our default component, which that it will be executed first amongst all the other components that we may create going forward. The index.js is the file that will first be read by Netlify when deployed. Thus, the App.js component has been passed to index.js and it is rendered inside the ReactDOM.render function.Step to Run Application: Run the application using the following command from the root directory of the project:Output: Now open your browser and go to http://localhost:3000/, you will see the following output:Dummy app running on localhost:3000Now we will see how to deploy our above create react application on netlify. There are mainly two methods for performing this task:Method 1: Using the netlify-cli(may not work in some cases). Below is the step by step implementation:Step 1:  Open the terminal and run this command,Note: This command will create a production build for our app which can be then deployed by the Netlify-cli.Creation of the production buildStep 2: Install the dependency,Installing the netlify-cli dependencyStep 3: First we need to initialize a project in Netlify so run the command:Here, select Create and configure a new site.Here, if you don’t have a project, you would need to create one, otherwise use the previously created one. I am using my previously created project “MyProject”.You will be asked to give a site name. After giving a site name, the site URL will be created but its still not deployed.Step 4: Now we will deploy the app using the following command.Site is deployed after running the commandNow we use the previously created URL, to open our deployed site.URL for site created using Method 1: https://hellofriend-v2.netlify.appMethod 2: Using github repository to deploy the app(the preferred method). Below is the step by step implementation:Step 1: Open github on your default browser and sign-in to your account.Click on “New” on the top-leftStep 2: Select “New Repository”. In the repository creation panel, give the repository a name and choose visibility to be “private”.Repository creation panelStep 3: After creating the repository, navigate to your project directory and open git bash, by right-clicking and selecting the option “Git Bash Here”.Select Git BashStep 4: Inside git bash, type the following commands in the exact order.Your app will now be uploaded to Github.Note: The SSH key will be available on the page of the newly created empty repository.Your SSH key is present under the “Quick setup” panelStep 5: Now go to Netlify.com on your default browser. Click on “New site from Git”Select “New site from Git”Step 6: In the following page, select the option Github.Select GitHub from belowStep 7: Select the repository where you have uploaded the app.Pick your repository from the listNote: The repository that we pick is “hellofriend”.Step 8: After that, simply click on Deploy. Netlify will start to deploy your app and you will have to wait for a few minutes.Click on “Deploy site” to start deploying the app.Step 9: After its done, you can view the app using the URL it creates.Site deploy in-progressSite has been deployed. Use the link to view the app.The deployed appNote: We had changed the name of the domain to “hello-f4iend”. You can do this by yourself in the Netlify site settings.Check out the deployed site here(using Method 2): https://hello-f4iend.netlify.app/This is a very useful bit of information that in my opinion, everyone should possess so they are able to deploy their creations with ease. ",reactjs,"['React-Questions', 'ReactJS', 'Web Technologies']",https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-deploy-simple-frontend-server-less-static-react-applications-on-netlify/
How a statement is handled inside switch block but outside case,"Switch case statements are a substitute for long if statements that compare a variable to several integral values. The switch statement is a multiway branch statement. It provides an easy way to dispatch execution to different parts of code based on the value of the expression. It is a control statement that allows a value to change control of execution.Syntax:Key Points:This article focuses on the third statement ‘The statement outside any case will NOT be executed’.Example 1: Predict the output of the following program:0Explanation: The garbage value is obtained as output even though the value of the test is supposed to be 10. It can be clearly seen that the print statement before case 1 is ignored (maybe removed during code optimization as part of dead code elimination) so it can be concluded that the previous statement is also not executed. It means the variable test is not declared. is it true? let’s see.Analyzer and Symbol Table: Lexical Analysis is the first phase of the compiler also known as a scanner or analyzer. It converts the High-level input program into a sequence of Tokens. These tokens can be of different types. The Symbol table is a data structure created and maintained by the compiler.  It stores information about the scope and binding information about names, information about instances of various entities such as variable and function names, classes, objects, etc.There are many columns in the symbol table but for simplicity, let’s take ‘variable name’ and ‘address’ fields.Example 1:  int x = 5;Lexical Analyzer:int – keywordx – identifier= – operator5 – constant; – special symbolSymbol Table:———————————————-| variable name | address |———————————————-| x | 0 |———————————————-Example 2:void main(int a){int b = a;}Lexical Analyzer:void- keywordmain – identifier() – special symbol{} – special symbolint – keyworda – identifierb – identifier= – operator; – special symbolSymbol Table-———————————————-| variable name | address |———————————————-| main | 0 |———————————————-| a | 4 |———————————————-| b | 8 |———————————————-If statements outside Case are not executed, how is it possible to use the variable ‘test’ without declaring it? Let’s look at how this line bypasses the analysis phase of compilation.Lexical Analyzer: Lexer will parse the whole program normally. This is the phase where the symbol table is created, the variable test is thus recognized as a token and added to the symbol table.———————————————-| variable name | address |———————————————-| test | 0 |———————————————-Syntax Analyzer: Looks at the syntax of the whole program. Structurally our program is perfectly fine. No error till now.Semantic Analyzer: it Will try to assign meaning to the parse tree. The variable test is assigned as an integer type and has successfully bypassed all analysis phases.——————————————————————| variable name | address | type |——————————————————————| test | 0 | int |——————————————————————Now identifier test has successfully occupied a place in the symbol table. The symbol table is populated with values at runtime, but because at runtime the lines 5 and 6 are not executed, the value for the variable test is not updated. Hence we get some garbage value as output.",cpp,"['cpp-switch', 'C++', 'C++ Programs', 'Program Output']",https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-a-statement-is-handled-inside-switch-block-but-outside-case/
"std::move in Utility in C++ | Move Semantics, Move Constructors and Move Assignment Operators","Prerequisites:References:In C++ there are two types of references-Move Constructor And Semantics:The move constructor was introduced in C++11. The need or purpose of a move constructor is to steal or move as many resources as it can from the source (original) object, as fast as possible, because the source does not need to have a meaningful value anymore, and/or because it is going to be destroyed in a moment anyway. So that one can avoid unnecessarily creating copies of an object and make efficient use of the resourcesWhile one can steal the resources, but one must leave the source (original) object in a valid state where it can be correctly destroyed.Move constructors typically “steal” the resource of the source (original) object rather than making several copies of them, and leaves the source object in a “valid but unspecified state”.The copy constructor uses the lvalue references which are marked with one ampersand (&) while the move constructor uses the rvalue references are marked with two ampersands (&&).std::move() is a function used to convert an lvalue reference into the rvalue reference. Used to move the resources from a source object i.e. for efficient transfer of resources from one object to another.std::move() is defined in the <utility> header.Syntax:template< class T > typename std::remove_reference<T>::type&& move(T&& t) noexcept; (since C++11)(until C++14) template< class T > constexpr std::remove_reference_t<T>&& move(T&& t) noexcept (since C++14)Example: Below is the C++ program to show what happens without using move semantics i.e. before C++11.Explanation:Assuming the program is compiled and executed using a compiler that doesn’t support move semantics. In the main() function,  1. std::vector<std::string> vecString;- An empty vector is created with no elements in it. 2. vecString = createAndInsert();- The createAndInsert() function is called.3. In createAndInsert() function-Note: Here, we unnecessarily allocate & deallocate the memory of the temporary string object. which can be optimized (improved) further just by moving the data from the source object. Example: Below is the C++ program to implement the above concept using move semantics i.e. since C++11 and later. Explanation:Here, in order to use the move semantics. The compiler must support the C++11 standards or above. The story of execution for the main() function and createAndInsert() function remains the same till the line vec.push_back( str );A question may arise why the temporary object is not moved to vector vec using std::move(). The reason behind it is the push_back() method of the vector. Since C++11 the push_back() method has been provided with its new overloaded version.Syntax: constexpr void push_back(const T& value); (since C++20) void push_back(T&& value); (since C++11) (until C++20) void push_back(const T& value); (until C++20) constexpr void push_back(T&& value); (since C++20)A question may arise while returning the vec object to its caller. As it is not required anymore and also a whole temporary object of a vector is going to be created and also local vector vec will be destroyed, then why std::move() is not used to steal the value and return it. Its answer is simple and obvious, there is optimization at the compiler level known as (Named) Return Value Object, more popularly known as RVO. Some Fallback Of Move Semantics: Note: The foo() function have all necessary types of arguments.Below is the C++ program to implement all the above concepts- Summary:  ",cpp,['simmytarika5'],https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/stdmove-in-utility-in-c-move-semantics-move-constructors-and-move-assignment-operators/
Java Equivalent of C++’s lower_bound() Method,"The lower_bound() method of C++ return the index of the first element in the array which has a value not less than key. This means that the function returns the index of the next smallest number just greater than or equal to that number. If there are multiple values that are equal to the number, lower_bound() returns the index of the first such value.Examples:  Now let us discuss out the methods in order to use lower bound() method in order to get the index of the next smallest number just greater than or equal to that number.Methods:Method 1: Using linear search Approach:We can use linear search to find lower bound. We will iterate over the array starting from the 0th index until we find a value equal to or greater than the key.ExampleTime Complexity: O(N), where N is the number of elements in the array.Auxiliary Space: O(1) We can use an efficient approach of binary search to search the key in the sorted array in O(log2 n) as proposed in the below example Method  2: Using binary search iterativelyProcedure:ExampleNow as usual optimizing further away by providing a recursive approach following the same procedure as discussed above.Method 3: Using binary search recursivelyMethod 4: Using binarySearch() method of Arrays utility classWe can also use the in-built binary search implementation of Arrays utility class (or Collections utility class). The function returns an index of the search key, if it is contained in the array; otherwise, (-(insertion point) – 1). The insertion point is defined as the point at which the key would be inserted into the array. Approach:ExampleNote: We can also find mid-value via any one of them",cpp,"['Blogathon-2021', 'Blogathon', 'C++', 'Java']",https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/java-equivalent-of-cpp-lower_bound-method/

What will happen if a print() statement is written inside a if() such as if(print()),"Pre-requisite: if-elseThis article focuses on discussing what happens when the print statement is used inside the if-else conditional statement.For example: Consider the below code and predict the output.Guessing the Expected Output: Most general guess for the output of this program is some sort of ERROR.Actual Output: But its actual output is a bit strange and not the expected one.  Explanation: Let’s discuss the reason. Let’s understand this by a program below-Explanation: When the printf statement is encountered it goes to the outer printf function and tries to print its value and when the program tries to print its value then it encounters another printf and it goes to inner printf (like a recursive call) to execute it and then it executes it and that inner printf function returns 5 because that function has successfully printed 5 characters (‘G’, ‘F’, ‘G’, ‘!’, and ‘\n’) and hence return an integer value equal to 5 in this case. Will print() used inside if always return true?From the above example, it can be easily understood how printf functions are working inside if statements and how the condition is being satisfied. The condition will always satisfy until and unless an empty string is printed like as shown in the below code- The only idea behind this example is to demonstrate if the printf function returns “0” only then the if condition would turn out to be false. In all other cases, it’ll be true whether the length of the string is 1 or 9999. ",cpp,"['princi singh', '29AjayKumar', 'shikhasingrajput', 'shivanisinghss2110']",https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-will-happen-if-a-print-statement-is-written-inside-a-if-such-as-ifprint/
How to find Size of std::forward_list in C++ STL,"Forward list in standard template library of C++. It comes under #include<forward_list> header file. It is implemented as a singly linked list. It was introduced in C++ 11 for the first time. Forward lists are sequence containers that allow constant time insert and erase operations from anywhere within the sequence. In the case of a forward list, fast random access is not supported.Unlike other STL libraries, std::forward_list does not have any size() method. Hence, in this article, we will show you how to get the size of a std::forward_list in C++ STL.There is a problem in retrieving the size of forward lists because std::forward_list doesn’t have any std::size() member function. To get the size of forward lists, one can use std::distance() function.Approach:Since std::distance() function takes two iterators as arguments and it returns an integer, the std::begin() and std::end() function can be passed which points to the address of the first item and the address just after the last item.Syntax:size = distance(forward_list.begin(), forward_list.end());Below is the C++ code to implement the above approach:",cpp,"['CPP-forward-list', 'STL', 'C++', 'C++ Quiz']",https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-find-size-of-stdforward_list-in-c-stl/

Abnormal behavior of floating point and double values,"Float is a 32 bit IEEE 754 single-precision Floating Point Number 1 bit for the sign, (8 bits for the exponent, and 23* for the value), i.e. float has 7 decimal digits of precision.Double is a 64 bit IEEE 754 double precision Floating Point Number (1 bit for the sign, 11 bits for the exponent, and 52* bits for the value), i.e. double has 15 decimal digits of precision.This article focuses on discussing the abnormal behavior of floating-point and double values.Program 1:Explanation: In the above program, the output is “it’s movie time” instead of “it’s geek time”. So here is the explanation for that as f is a floating-point value and ‘0.2’ is a double value so due to the precision difference of both data types, this abnormal behavior can be seen. In the statement,  if(f==0.2), f is being compared with 0.2 thus internally it’s written like this:As 0.2 is the first cast into float while declaring and assigning in the above line (due to which the precision decreases and it gets rounded after some value and loss of some info/precision occurs) and after that, it is again cast into the double in the if statement but the lost value can not be fetched back. Hence, this behavior can be seen.For a more clear understanding, let’s take an example(analogy) of the base 10 number system.Let’s take 10/3 and represent it to 5 significant figures: 3.3333 or 3.3334 (in the case of rounding off). That’s the “float” f. Now convert the value of f to a value with 8 significant figures (f to “double”)- 3.3333000 or 3.3334000 (in the case of rounding off). That’s not equal to 3.3333333 (The value of 10/3 directly as a double). Replace float f = 0.2 with double f = 0.2 or long double f = 0.2 while declaring/initializing the variable:Below is the C/C++ program to illustrate the above idea:Typecast 0.2 to a float while comparing inside the if statement:Below is the C/C++ program to illustrate the above idea:Write 0.2 as a floating-point value: Below is the C/C++ program to illustrate the above idea:By checking if the difference between both the values is very minute(1e-9) by declaring an acceptableDifference variable:Below is the C/C++ program to illustrate the above idea:Note: This last method is preferred when there is no requirement to change the data type of any variable anywhere in the program else any of the above methods listed can be followed too as they are easy, short, and less complicated.

Rust – Box Smart Pointer,"Box allows us to store data in the heap contrary to the default scheme of Rust to store as a stack.Box is basically used for:Let’s create a box to store i32 value in a heap.Example:Output:We will be using a cons list to create a list of values. cons list takes two values the first one is the current value and the other is the next value, it performs a recursive call to cons function to generate a list, where the base condition for the recursive call is Nil.Example:It won’t compile because the List variable size cannot be determined prior to compilation.Output:There is an error that tells the List has infinite size because the compiler cannot determine the size of List during compilation. So we will be using a pointer to the list rather than the list itself to overcome this error. Since the size of the pointer is fixed irrespective of the data type to which it is pointing, therefore the compiler can determine its size during compilation. Let’s see this implementation using Box<T>.Example:Output:",rust,"['Picked', 'Rust custom-types', 'Rust']",https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/rust-box-smart-pointer/
Rust – Recoverable Errors,"An error is basically an unexpected behavior or event that may lead a program to produce undesired output or terminate abruptly. Errors are things that no one wants in their program. Recoverable errors are those that do not cause the program to terminate abruptly. Example- When we try to fetch a file that is not present or we do not have permission to open it.Most language does not distinguish between the two errors and use an Exception class to overcome them while Rust uses a data type Result <R,T> to handle recoverable errors and panic! macro to stop the execution of the program in case of unrecoverable errors. Result<T,E> is an enum data type with two variants OK and Err which is defined something like this:-T and E are generic type parameters where T represents the type of value that will be returned in a success case within the Ok variant, and E represents the type of error that will be returned in a failure case within the Err variant.OutputSince the file gfg.txt was not there so the Err instance was returned by File. If the file gfg.txt had been found then an instance to the file would have been returned.If a file is not found just like the above case then it will be better if we ask the user to check the file name, file location or to give the file specifications once more or whatever the situation demands.OutputIn the above program, it basically matches the return type of the result and performs the task accordingly.Let’s create our own errors according to business logic. Suppose we want to produce an error if a person below 18 years tries to apply for voter ID.OutputIf we want to abort the program after it encounters a recoverable error then we could use panic! macro and to simplify the process Rust provides two methods unwrap() and expect().OutputThe unwrap() calls the panic! macro in case of file not found while it returns the file handler instance if the file is found. Although unwrap() makes the program shorter but when there are too many unwrap() methods in our program then it becomes a bit confusing as to which unwrap() method is called the panic! macro. So we need something that can produce the customized message. In that case, expect() method comes to the rescue.Output:We passed our message to panic! macro via the expect parameter.",rust,"['Picked', 'Rust']",https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/rust-recoverable-errors/
Rust – Concept of Ownership,"Rust programming language is known for its memory management. This article explains how Rust uses its Ownership model for better memory management. If you want to have a recap of Rust syntax before getting on this article you can refer to the Rust Archives.Generally, there are 2 ways to manage memory in a program by using either Garbage Collects (or) programmer has to explicitly define the memory usage. Both the options have their advantages and disadvantages like explicit managing being faster but Garbage collection being easier to implement. Rust follows a new approach called “Ownership” which promises to be faster and will be easier when you get used to it.  The ownership model is new for programmers but when you understand and start practicing you can get better at using it.Memory safety is the property of a program where memory pointers always used to point to valid memory of the correct type and size. A memory unsafe program may crash or produce unexpected output and errors. It also may cause data leaks which in turn reducing the security of the program. One of the examples that can cause memory safety issues is Dangling pointers(pointers that point to invalid data (or) null).Rust stores primitive datatypes directly into the memory but complex datatypes are generally stored in either Stack (or) Heap.Stack stores variables of size at compile time.A stack follows a last in first out order. All scalar types can be stored in the stack as the size is fixed. If the size of the variable is unknown at compile time then they are stored in a heap which is suitable for dynamic datatypes. Heap is allocated used to store variables that may change throughout the life cycle of the program. Performing operations on a stack are faster than heap because of fixed size and direct access.Rust ownership rules are the guidelines (or) standards for the Ownership model. These areHere is a simple Rust program following the above rulesOutput:Let us look into the program once. The main function has only one line calling print_gfg() function. The print_gfg() function prints out the string “GeeksForGeeks”.  We used the variable “gfg” to store the string “GeeksForGeeks”, so gfg will become the string, and as it is declared in print_gfg() function the scope of the variable where its is the owner and valid is till the end of the function.Rust ownershipIn the above program, we have seen how a variable can access data, Now we will see an example of how multiple interacts with the same data.In this Program the variable gfg1 copies data in variable gfg but is valid because size of the variable is known before compile time, so Rust stores the variable in stack.program validNow lets us look at a program where data is stored in heap and try to copy that data to another variableThis gives an error because the size of gfg variable is unknown at compile-time and when we refer gfg1 to gfg the pointer moves from gfg to gfg1 rather than copying. To make it copy the data rather than moving it wen need to use the clone methodcloneYou can learn more about how Rust handles multiple data variables from References and Borrowing",rust,"['Picked', 'Rust']",https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/rust-concept-of-ownership/
Rust – Concept of Smart Pointers,"Pointers are basically variables that store the address of another variable.  While smart pointers are data types that behave like a traditional pointer with additional capabilities such as automatic memory management or bounds checking.What makes smart pointers different from normal pointers are:-What makes smart pointers different from structs:-Deref trait allows an instance of a smart pointer struct to behave like a reference so that the code that works with pointers can also work with smart pointers.Drop trait allows us to customize the code that should run when an instance of the smart pointer goes out of scope.Some of the smart pointers are:-Box<T>Box allows us to store data in the heap contrary to the default scheme of Rust to store as a stack.Box is basically used:Let’s create a box to store i32 value in a heapOutputUsing Box<T> for recursive typeWe will be using cons list to create a list of values. cons list takes to values the first one is the current value and the other is the next value, it performs a recursive call to cons function to generate a list, where the base condition for the recursive call is Nil.It won’t compile because the List variable size cannot be determined prior to compilation.Output:There is an error that tells the List has infinite size because the compiler cannot determine the size of List during compilation. So we will be using a pointer to the list rather than the list itself to overcome this error. Since the size of the pointer is fixed irrespective of the data type to which it is pointing to, therefore the compiler can determine its size during compilation. Let’s see this implementation using Box<T>Output:Defining our own smart pointer:Here, we have defined a Custom smart pointer as a tuple struct with one value. We have defined a new method which is called when the smart pointer is instantiated, that returns a custom smart pointer.Just like an ordinary pointer, we can get the value of the box by using the ‘*’ operator.Output:Whenever the instance of smart pointer goes out of scope then the drop function is called.Output:",rust,"['Picked', 'Rust']",https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/rust-concept-of-smart-pointers/
Rust – Switch Case,"Switch statement is basically nested if statement, though it does not support expression, it matches an int, string, or boolean data type variable with a given set of cases that are provided by the programmer. It is mainly used in a menu-driven program where the user selects which function they want to run. A switch case in Rust is achieved by the keyword match. Let’s see a few examples to see how it works.Unlike C or Java, only the case corresponding to the match is executed, so we need not worry about fall through. Thereby saving our effort to write a break statement after each case. Default case, where no match is found, is handled by the case ‘_’ (underscore). There is something special in Rust, the cases can have more than one value. Example:OutputSeveral values can be included in a single case by separating them via ‘|’.Example:Output It’s not the end we can also include a range of values in each case.  A range is inclusive in this case that means both the ends are also included.Example:OutputAs stated in the beginning we can also use boolean values to match cases, we will now go for it. One more thing is that match can be used in an expression.Example:OutputAt last, we will see how strings are used in matches.Example:Output",rust,"['rust-control-flow', 'Rust']",https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/rust-switch-case/
Rust – Concept of Structures,"Structures are basically user-defined type mainly used for grouping different data types together. It overcomes the limitation of a traditional array that can only contain elements of the same data type. A structure can also contain a structure in itself. In Rust, structures are similar to tuples, but structure elements are easily accessible since they are named instead of indexed in the case of tuples.In Rust, structures are of three typesA structure is defined by struct keyword followed by the key-pair elements.Here we have defined a Student structure using the struct keyword and its elements -“name”, “roll” and “dept”, along with their expected data types. We have also defined the unit struct and the tuple struct. When we defined the structure, no memory is allocated to it. Only when we will initialize it then it will be allocated.Now, we will initialize our Student structure. Structure elements are accessed using the “.” (dot) operator.Output:Since we want to update the value of a structure so the variable by which we are initializing it i.e. student1 in the above case should be declared mut (a variable that can be updated), otherwise by default it is immutable (can’t be updated). Output:As earlier said, we can use a structure within another structure. Let us see.Output:Here we tried to add address structure into student structure. One thing to be noted is that the addr structure should be defined before the student structure and the same goes during initialization. Notice the method used to access the elements of a structure that is part of another structure. For this, we have used the dot operator twice as in student1.addr.pin.Defining methods for a structureOutput:We started an impl (implementation) block, within which we defined the method area for the triangle. We passed the address of the instance of the struct to the function and used self to refer to it.",rust,"['Picked', 'Rust struct', 'Rust']",https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/rust-concept-of-structures/
Rust – References & Borrowing,"As Rust Ownership rules say one owner at a time but there might some cases where we need to perform an action on data without affecting its original value. This is done via borrowing. Borrowing is like in general when we borrow something, and we are done with it, we give it back, but this doesn’t make us the owner of the data. Reference is an address that is passed to a function as an argument, and they always start with ampersand(&).Let taken an exampleThe variable gfg contains a string and is passed on to a function calculate_length as a reference which means gfg_len borrows the value of variable gfg to calculate its length, and it returns the borrowed at the end of the function. The function then returns the length of the passed reference string.referenceVisual Representation of References:visual representationNow let us try to change the value of the borrowed program and see what we getLike variables in Rust, all references are mutable by default. Let us try to change the value we are referencing.This gives an error because values borrowed can’t be modified because we aren’t the owner of the value.Rust supports mutable references which means we can change the value it references if it’s a mutable variable. There are some restrictions on how we use mutable references.Let us change the program above to be valid",rust,"['Picked', 'Rust-basics', 'Rust']",https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/rust-references-borrowing/
Rust – Error Handling,"An error is basically an unexpected behavior or event that may lead a program to produce undesired output or terminate abruptly. Errors are things that no one wants in their program. We can try to find and analyze parts of the program that can cause errors. Once we found those parts then we can define how those parts should behave if they encounter an error. This process of finding and defining cases for a particular block of code is what we call Error Handling. One thing we should keep in mind that we cannot completely get rid of errors but we can try to minimize them or at least reduce their effect on our program.In Rust, errors can be classified into two categories namely recoverable and unrecoverableMost language does not distinguish between the two errors and use an Exception class to overcome them while Rust uses a data type Result <R,T> to handle recoverable errors and panic! macro to stop the execution of the program in case of unrecoverable errors. We will first see how and where should we use panic! macro. Before it, we will see what it does to a program.Output:So, it basically stops the execution of the program and prints what we passed it in its parameter.panic! the macro may be in library files that we use, let us see some:Output:Since we are trying to access elements beyond the bounds of vector therefore it called a panic! macro.We should only use panic in a condition if our code may end up in a bad state. A bad state is when some assumption, guarantee, contract, or invariant has been broken, such as when invalid values, contradictory values, or missing values are passed to our code and at least one of the following:-Result<T,E> is an enum data type with two variants OK and Err which is defined something like thisT and E are generic type parameters where T represents the type of value that will be returned in a success case within the Ok variant, and E represents the type of error that will be returned in a failure case within the Err variant. Output:Since the file gfg.txt was not there so the Err instance was returned by File. If the file gfg.txt had been found then an instance to the file would have been returned. If a file is not found just like the above case then it will be better if we ask the user to check the file name, file location or to give the file specifications once more or whatever the situation demands.Output:In the above program, it basically matches the return type of the result and performs the task accordingly.Let’s create our own errors according to business logic. Suppose we want to produce an error if a person below 18 years tries to apply for voter ID.Output:If we want to abort the program after it encounters a recoverable error then we could use panic! macro and to simplify the process Rust provides two methods unwrap() and expect().Output:The unwrap() calls the panic! macro in case of file not found while it returns the file handler instance if the file is found. Although unwrap() makes the program shorter but when there are too many unwrap() methods in our program then it becomes a bit confusing as to which unwrap() method called the panic! macro. So we need something that can produce the customized messages. In that case, expect() method comes to the rescue.Output:We passed our message to panic! macro via the expected parameter.",rust,"['Picked', 'Rust exceptions', 'Rust']",https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/rust-error-handling/
Rust – Strings,"String data type makes a very important part of any programming language. Rust handles strings a bit differently from other languages.  The String data type in Rust is of two types:String Literal or &str are called ‘string slices’, which always point to a legitimate UTF-8 sequence. It is used when we know the value of a string at compile time. They are a set of characters and static by default.Example 1: Declaring string literals.Output:The String Object is provided by the Standard Library in Rust. It is not a part of the core language and String is heap-allocated, growable, and not null-terminated. They are commonly created by converting them from a string slice by using the to_string() method.Example 2: Declaring String Object and converting String Literal to String ObjectOutput:Example 3: Creating an empty string and then set its value.Output:Rust allows many methods to be used with Strings just as JAVA does. Also, it supports many methods such as indexing, concatenation, and slicing.",rust,"['Picked', 'Rust-basics', 'strings', 'Rust']",https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/rust-strings/
Rust – Drop Trait,"Drop trait lets us customize what happens when a value is about to go out of scope. Drop trait is important to the smart pointer pattern. Drop trait functionality is used when implementing a smart pointer. For example, Box<T> customizes Drop to deallocate the space on the heap that the box points to.Drop trait can be used to clean up values when they go out of scope.Syntax:Variables are dropped in the reverse order of their creation, so d was dropped before c. In Rust, the drop is automatically called up when our instances go out of scope.With the help of the given examples, it will be easy to understand that how the drop method works:Example 1:Output 1:Example 2:Output 2:The std::mem::drop function is not the same as the drop method in the Drop trait. We can call it by passing the value we want to drop the value before the end of the scope. In Rust, we cannot call the Drop trait’s drop method manually but we have to call the std::mem::drop function. Example:In the above example, we call the drop() method manually. The Rust compiler throws an error that we are not allowed to call the drop() method explicitly. Instead of calling the drop() method explicitly, we call the std::mem::drop function to drop the value before it goes out of the scope.The syntax of std::mem::drop function is different from the drop() function defined in the Drop trait. The std::mem::drop function contains the value passed as an argument which is to be dropped before it goes out of the scope.Output:",rust,"['Picked', 'Rust traits', 'Rust']",https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/rust-drop-trait/
Vectors in Julia,"Vectors in Julia are a collection of elements just like other collections like Array, Sets, Dictionaries, etc. Vector are different from Sets because vectors are ordered collection of elements, and can hold duplicate values, unlike sets which require all the elements to be unique. Vectors are one-dimensional arrays, and support mostly the same interface as their multi-dimensional counterparts. Syntax:vector_name = [value1, value2, value3,..]vector_name = Vector{DataType}([value1, value2, value3,..])Note: Vector{T} where T is some type means the same as Array{T,1}.Vector{Int}Array{Int64,1}# Vector{Int} = one-dimensional Vector of Int64.Vector{Float64}Array{Float64,1}A 1D Vector or 1-dimensional Vector is a linear representation of elements. A 1D Vector can only have either a row or a column. It represents a type of list that can be accessed by subsequent memory locations. Vectors can be resized. Elements can be added or removed from the front or back of the vector.A Vector in Julia can be created with the use of a pre-defined keyword Vector() or by simply writing Vector elements within square brackets([]). There are different ways of creating Vector.Output:Elements of a vector can be accessed by passing the index of the value in the vector as a parameter to the vector_name. This index is passed within ‘[ ]’. A range of vector elements can be accessed by passing the index range with the use of ‘:’.Example: Accessing elements in a VectorOutput:It pushes the elements into a vector from the rear end. This push operation is performed with the use of a predefined push!() function.Output:It is used to pop or remove elements from a vector from the rear end. This pop operation is performed with the use of pop!() function.Output:Julia provides a predefined function called unshift!() to push the elements into a vector from the front end.Output:Julia provides a predefined function called shift!() which is used to pop or remove elements from a vector from the front.Output:To add a list of items into a vector, julia provides a predefined function append!().Output:Sum of vector elements can be calculated with the use of Julia’s predefined function sum().Output:To compute the average of vector elements, Julia provides a predefined function mean() to calculate the average of elements.Output:Output:Output:",julia,"['Picked', 'Julia']",https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/vectors-in-julia/
Logistic Regression in Julia,"Logistic Regression, as the name suggests is completely opposite in functionality. Logistic Regression is basically a predictive algorithm in Machine Learning used for binary classification. It predicts the probability of a class and then classifies it based on the predictor variables’ values.The dependent variable(y) in logistic regression, is binary and takes 2 possible values 0 or 1. For example: If we want to check if the mail is spam or not. Then y will have values – 1 for spam and 0 for not spam.Logistic regression is analogous to linear regression in some aspects, just that in linear regression y is a continuous variable, whereas in logistic regression y needs to lie between 0 and 1. As, y is nothing but the predicted value and predicted value is nothing but the probability of y equals to 1, P(y = 1).We know, the equation for linear regression:Now, we know that this equation yields a continuous value of y. So as to restrict the predicted value of y in the 0 – 1 range, we apply the sigmoid function. The sigmoid function is,Computing the value of y from the above equation and then putting in the linear regression equation, we get:Hence, we finally get the equation for Logistic Regression. Using this equation, we can find the value of the probability of y when the value of x is known. In the above equation, b0  is the intercept and b1 is the slope matrix for all values of x. Collectively, we can refer to all as regression coefficients.To learn more I will take the example of the Churn Modelling Data, a well-known dataset to predict a customer has churned out or not based on a number of features. Let’s start with it in Julia.In this step, we will import all the required packages we will be using. Don’t be afraid if you miss any package, you can definitely add it simultaneously.Output:To read the data we use the CSV.file function and then convert it into data frame using DataFrame function.Output:Output:The dependent variable, y in this case is the last column (‘Exited’). The first column is just the row numbers and the variable from the second column are predictors or independent variables. Also, the size of our dataset is 10,000 rows and 14 columns. From the summary, we find that the dataset has no missing or null values. The column names don’t have any spaces or special characters in them, hence we can go further without any problem.Output:We use the glm function for logistic regression.Output:Once, we have built our model and trained it, we would evaluate the model on test data to see how accurately it works.Output:The glm model gives us the probability score of class 1. After getting the probability score we need to classify it as 0 or 1 based n the threshold score. Usually, the threshold is considered 0.5.With the help of the above code, we got the probability scores. Now, let’s convert these into classes 0 or 1. For probability > 0.5 will be given class 1, otherwise 0.Output:After, predicting the classes of our test data, the next step is to evaluate the model by analyzing the accuracy.By Accuracy, we mean the total number of classes our model predicted correctly.Output:So, our model yields an accuracy of approximately 80% which is a good score. Now, to get better insights of accuracy we analyze the confusion matrix.The confusion matrix is just another way to evaluate the performance of any classification model.Output:The above output informs us that due to class imbalance our model classifies maximum observations as class 0. This is the reason for a moderate accuracy of 80%.",julia,"['Picked', 'Julia']",https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/logistic-regression-in-julia/
Polynomial Regression in Julia,"In statistics, polynomial regression is a form of regression analysis in which the relationship between the independent variable x and the dependent variable y is modeled as an nth degree polynomial in x. Polynomial regression fits a nonlinear relationship between the value of x and the corresponding conditional mean of y, denoted E(y |x). Polynomial regression is one example of regression analysis using basis functions to model a functional relationship between two quantities.Polynomial Regression in Julia can be implemented by using Polynomials.jl package. Polynomials.jl is a Julia package that provides basic arithmetic, integration, differentiation, evaluation, and root finding over dense univariate polynomials.To install the package, runpkg> add PolynomialsOnce the package installed, you can load the package usingusing PolynomialsSyntax:julia> using PolynomialsNow, let’s see how can we use Polynomial.jl to achieve arithmetic, integration, differentiation, evaluation, and root finding over dense univariate polynomials.The usual arithmetic operators are overloaded to work on polynomials and combinations of polynomials and scalars.The following arithmetic operators are supported on all primitive numeric types:Integrate the polynomial p term by term, optionally adding a constant term k. The degree of the resulting polynomial is one higher than the degree of p (for a nonzero polynomial).Differentiate the polynomial p term by term. The degree of the resulting polynomial is one lower than the degree of p.Return the roots (zeros) of p, with multiplicity. The number of roots returned is equal to the degree of p. By design, this is not type-stable, the returned roots may be real or complex.Fit a polynomial (of degree deg or less) to x and y using a least-squares approximation.",julia,['Julia'],https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/polynomial-regression-in-julia/
Decision Tree Classifiers in Julia,"In statistics in Julia, classification is the problem of identifying to which of a set of categories (sub-populations) a new observation belongs, on the basis of a training set of data containing observations (or instances) whose category membership is known.In the terminology of machine learning, classification is considered an instance of supervised learning, i.e., learning where a training set of correctly identified observations is available.Some of the classification techniques which we have are:A Decision Tree is a simple representation of classifying examples. It is a Supervised Machine Learning where the data is continuously split according to a certain parameter.Decision trees are commonly used in operations research and operations management. If in practice, decisions have to be taken online with no recall under incomplete knowledge, a decision tree should be paralleled by a probability model as the best choice model or online selection model algorithm. Another use of decision trees is as a descriptive means for calculating conditional probabilities.A decision tree has mainly three components:Decision Tree is a flow chart like structurePackages and RequirementsOutput:Output:",julia,['Julia'],https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/decision-tree-classifiers-in-julia/
How to Import Python Packages in Julia?,"Julia is a high-level, high-performance, dynamic programming language for numerical computing.  Users can import arbitrary Python modules and libraries into Julia. PyCall package is provided for calling Python from Julia code. You can use PyCall from any Julia code, including within Julia modules. And add this package to the Julia environment with Pkg.add (“PyCall”).PyCall provides many routines for manipulating Python objects in Julia via a type PyObject. In most cases, PyCall automatically makes the appropriate type conversions to Julia types based on runtime inspection of the Python objects.To Import Python Packages in Julia. Follow the steps below:Step 1: using Pkg  Step 2: Pkg.add(“PyCall”)  Step 3: using PyCall  Step 4: @pyimport python_library_name or  Step 4: pyimport(“python_library_name”)  Example 1: Output:Example 1 Example 2:  Output:Example 2 Use the following to run packages that are not standard (and are local to your Python IDLE) or using a different environment instead of the standard python env that Julia chooses when @pyimport is invoked. After executing the following two lines, stop and restart the Julia REPL. Note that the location provided corresponds to the directory where your python.exe is located. In my case it was C:\\Users\\hi\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Python\\Python37. Once you have restarted Julia, you can use the usual pyimport to call the respective package local to your installation.  Let’s look at an example where I have a package named “cantera” for thermochemical calculations installed in my local environment.

Array Interfaces in Julia,An array interface is a syntactical contract for arrays in Julia that they must follow. This article describes the various methods which can be adopted to construct array interfaces in Julia. It also explains how to perform indexing in an array interface to access its elements.An array interface can be constructed by taking a standard array and linking custom keys along with the indices of each dimension. This can be achieved by using the AxisIndices package.Construction of an Array Using AxisArray Function:An array can be created using the AxisArray() function present in the AxisIndices package of Julia. Example: Output:An array interface can also be initialized using the following syntax:Syntax:Example:Output:Construction of an Array Using NamedAxisArray() Function:Each Dimension or axis of the array interface can be given names using NamedAxisArray present in the AxisIndices package of Julia.Example:Output:Construction of an Array Using MetaAxisArray() Function:Metadata can also be linked with the array interface.Example:Output:Indexing in an Array Interface Using Unitful Package:An array interface can be indexed just like standard arrays in Julia.

K-Means Clustering in Julia,"Clustering is the task of grouping a set of objects(all values in a column) in such a way that objects in the same group are more similar to each other than to those in other groups. K-means clustering is one of the simplest and popular unsupervised machine learning algorithms.Unsupervised algorithms make inferences from datasets using only input vectors without referring to known, or labeled, outcomes.Define a target number k, which refers to the number of centroids you need in the dataset. A centroid is the imaginary or real location representing the center of the cluster.Every data point is allocated to each of the clusters by reducing the in-cluster sum of squares. K-means algorithm identifies k number of centroids, and then allocates every data point to the nearest cluster while keeping the centroids as small as possible.Note: Means in k-means refers to averaging of the data.How it is achieved in Julia?In Julia, it can be achieved with the help of some algorithms. K means is one such algorithm. This can simply be achieved with the help of inbuilt functions like kmeans(). This function divides the data into clusters having similar features: Data, no. of clusters we require, iter: keyword if we want to know how many iterations did it take to create clusters are passed as arguments in this function.Packages involved: RDatasets package provides access to many of the classical data sets that are available in R.Functions involved:Following are the steps involved to perform clustering in Existing Dataset: Step 1: In the dataset() function passing the datasets and iris as arguments and storing the data in the dataframe iris.Step 2: Now after storing the data in the dataframe we need to create a 2D Matrix which can be achieved with help of Matrix() function.Step 3: Now storing the matrix in the features dataframe which represents the total rows and columns required to form a cluster of the fetched array with help of the collect() function.Step 4: Now applying the function kmeans() and passing the features and no. of clusters as arguments.Step 5: Plotting the clusters with help of scatter() function to get scatter plot of 4 clusters here with different colors.Final Code:Output:                                               Following are the steps involved to perform clustering after creating a Dataset: Step 1: Forming a dataset with random numbers using rand() function and storing it into the dataframe also passing the dimensions required for the random numbers.Step 2: Now simply apply the kmeans() function and pass the random numbers dataframe, to display the iterations pass the argument display=:iter, also we need to pass the value for maxiter maximum iterations this function allowed to do.Step 3: Verify the numbers of clusters formed with nclusters() function by passing the results of kmeans() as an argument, and we will get bool values true or false.Step 4: We can now get the assigned points to the clusters with help of assignments() function and passing the (R) returned clusters from kmeans().Step 5: We can also get the sizes of the clusters with help of simple function counts(R)Step 6: At last we can get values of cluster centers with R as object and accessing centers.Final Code:Output:",julia,"['Julia Data-science', 'Julia-Machine-learning', 'Julia']",https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/k-means-clustering-in-julia/
